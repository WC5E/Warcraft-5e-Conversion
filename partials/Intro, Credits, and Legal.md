## Foreword

This foreword will likely change with each different book that we're talking about, as will the changelog link presented in this foreword.

The foreword could probably also be an 'About' or 'Intro', but for now it's called the 'Foreword' since it was that previously. 

With each coming update, all changes will be noted in the Changelog — Link is provided below.

<br> **Want to join our community?**
<br><span style="margin-left:12px"></span> We're a relatively small group working together on this,
<br><span style="margin-left:12px"></span> and we think it's fun to hear the thoughts and opinions
<br><span style="margin-left:12px"></span> of people who have played with it. If you want to share
<br><span style="margin-left:12px"></span> your stories with us, suggest changes, or just join our
<br><span style="margin-left:12px"></span> Warcraft RPG community, we have both a Discord
<br><span style="margin-left:12px"></span> server and a subreddit going.

## Made with GM Binder

This entire book was made using GM Binder. It is an amazing tool for creating authentic-looking homebrew material for 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons.  Without it, this project would've likely never been considered.

## Legal Stuff

In accordance with [statements presented by Blizzard Entertainment](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/28d5ebbf-c245-4408-8ba9-043dd5f056bf/legal-faq), for use of Blizzard trademarks in the creation of "total conversions", we the providers of the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition material presented in here make it all available for free.

There will never be a cost required to access any of it. This project will always remain free.

Depending on viewpoint, this project could be viewed as an "adaption" rather than a "total conversion" of Blizzard Entertainment's intellectual property. 

We have however seen a number of long-lived and still going conversion projects, adopting properties such as *Warcraft* and *Diablo* to other games -- including other tabletop RPG conversions of such. The common denominator between is that they are all creative endeavours and not marketed products.

We understand that our ability to work on this project may be revoked should Blizzard Entertainment find it in violation of their End User License Agreement.
