## Foreword </div>
We've made this book in an attempt to bring the beloved Warcraft franchise into the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. It is a task that has taken us months to do, and many more to come as we continue to work on this in our spare time, in the hopes of bringing a genuine recreation of Warcraft into a tabletop game.

This book is made to compliment Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition **Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide**, and **Monster Manuals**. Using the rules presented in those books, and balanced around being playable in a standard D&D setting without requiring balancing.

This books is made in our spare time with the intention of always being a free resource for everyone to use. Never to be bought or paid for. We've made this because we want others to enjoy the Warcraft universe in a Dungeons & Dragons format. Not for any monetary gain.

With each coming update, all changes will be noted in the Changelog--Link is provided below. Likewise we've provided a link to our racial balance spreadsheet, using the rules of Detect Balance by  Eleazzaar.

# Chapter 1: Bestiary
Here's a tip, don't get killed <3

\columnbreak

## Statistics
A monster's statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**, provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.

### Size
A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. See the 5th edition *Player's Handbook* for more information on creature size and space.

##### Size Categories
|&nbsp; Size       | Space | Examples |
|:-----------------|:-----------|:-:|
|&nbsp; Tiny       | 2½ by 2½ ft. |
|&nbsp; Small      | 5 by 5 ft. |
|&nbsp; Medium     | 5 by 5 ft. |
|&nbsp; Large      | 10 by 10 ft. |
|&nbsp; Huge       | 15 by 15 ft. |
|&nbsp; Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |

> ##### Modifying Creatures
> Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this block, you might be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of an adventure. Feel free to tweak a creature to make it into something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two from a different monster or by using a **variant** or **template**, such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster, including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge rating.

### Type
A monster's type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other creatures of the dragon type, such as drakonids and drakeadons.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of their own.

**Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature's alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quin&shy;tessential aberrations are forgotten ones, nerubians, and beings of the old gods.

**Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2 | INTRODUCTION </div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/RVaHjr8.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:0px; width:900px' />

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Constructs** are made, not born. Some are programmed by their creators to follow a set of instructions, while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs.

**Dragons** are reptilian creatures of ancient origin and tremendous power. The dragonflights are highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to the dragonflights, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as dragonspawns and proto-drakes.

**Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental plane. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses of their respective elements. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy. The races of elemen&shy;tal creatures include ascendants, bound and unbound elementals, and revenants.

**Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. They are closely tied to the Emerald Dream. Fey include dryads, faerie dragons, and wisps.

**Fiends** are creatures of wickedness native to worlds beyond Azeroth. Many originate from the Great Dark Beyond and its Twisting Nether, others were corrupted on planets far away. Fiends all serve Sargeras the Dark Titan, and in turn the Void Lords themselves. Fiends include demons, infernals, and eredars.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are enor-mous creatures created by the titans, many of whom still show the stone shapes of their makers. Giants include sea giants, ogres, breakers, and vrykuls.

**Humanoids** are the main peoples of Azeroth, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, orcs, trolls, and dwarves.

A variety of humanoids appear throughout this book, but the races detailed in the *Heroes Handbook* are dealt with in appendix B. That appendix gives you a number of stat blocks that you can use to make variations of those races.

**Monstrosities** are monsters, frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation gone awry, and others are the product of terrible curses. They defy categorization, and in some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures that don't fit into any type.

**Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed shape. They adapt to their environment, taking on aspects of their surroundings.

**Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the ancients and treants. Fungal creatures such as sporelings and the mandragora also fall into this category.

**Titans** are beings made by titans themselves. Many resemble constructs, being massive creatures made of stone or other inanimate materials. Titans include titan constructs, titanforged, and titanic watchers.

**Undeads** are once-living creatures brought to a horrify-ing state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as the san'layn and zombies, as well as bodi&shy;less spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

\columnbreak

#### Tags
A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the human&shy;oid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any monster that has the demon tag.

### Alignment
A monster's alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack characters on sight, while a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. See the *Heroes Handbook* for descriptions of the different alignments.

The alignment specified in a monster's stat block is the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster's alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you want a good-aligned doomguard or an evil keeper of the grove, there's nothing stopping you.

Some creatures can have **any alignment**. Meaning, You can choose the monster's alignment. Some monster's alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehen&shy;sion of law or chaos, good or evil. They don't make moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means they don't have an alignment.

### Armor Class
A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a monster's AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

### Hit Points
A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.

A monster's hit points are presented both as a die expres&shy;sion and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 x 4½).

##### Hit Dice by Size
|&nbsp; Monster Size | Hit Dice | Average HP per Die |
|:-------------------|:---:|:---:|
|&nbsp; Tiny         |  d4 |  2½ |
|&nbsp; Small        |  d6 |  3½ |
|&nbsp; Medium       |  d8 |  4½ |
|&nbsp; Large        | d10 |  5½ |
|&nbsp; Huge         | d12 |  6½ |
|&nbsp; Gargantuan   | d20 | 10½ |

A monster's Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

\pagebreakNum

### Speed
A monster's speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more information on speed, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the monster's speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.

Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Burrow
A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can't burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Climb
A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn't need to spend extra movement to climb.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Fly
A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as ex&shy;plained in the rules on flying in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

#### Swim
A monster that has a swimming speed doesn't need to spend extra movement to swim.

### Ability Scores
Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corrsponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they're used in play, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

### Saving Throws
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn't easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most creatures don't have special saving throw bonuses, in which case this section is absent.

A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is deter&shy;mined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).

> ##### Armor, Weapon, & Tool Proficiency
> Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is proficient with its new equipment.
>
> For example, a ogre typically wears hide armor and wields a greatclub. You could equip an ogre with chain mail and a greataxe instead, and assume the ogre is proficient with both, one or the other, or neither.
>
> See the 5th edition *Player's Handbook* for rules on using armor or weapons without proficiency.

### Skills
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. 

A skill bonus is the sum of a monster's relevant ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster's challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifier might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, <br>and Immunities
Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Additionally, some creatures are immune to certain conditions. If a monster is immune to a game effect that isn't considered damage or a condition, it has a special trait.

### Senses
The Senses entry notes a monster's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.

#### Blindsight
A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.

Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or height&shy;ened senses, such as bats and the dragonflights.

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.

#### Darkvision
A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.

#### Tremorsense
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.

#### Truesight
A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.

### Languages
The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can't speak it, and this is noted in its entry.

A "—" indicates that a creature neither speaks nor under&shy;stands any language.

#### Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted creature doesn't need to share a language with the monster to communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond to telepathic messages but can't initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn't need to see the creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A telepathic monster can initiative or terminate a telepathic conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can't initiate telepathic contact, and contact is terminated.

A creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or in any other location where magic doesn't function can't send or receive telepathic messages.

\columnbreak

### Challenge
A monster's **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-rested party of four adventurers should be able to defeat monsters that has a challenge rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a party of four 3rd-level characters should find a monster with a challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that have attacks are worth 10 XP each.

Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.

#### Experience Points
The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the monster although the DM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.

Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.

The 5th edition *Dungeon Master's Guide* explains how to create encounters using XP budgets, as well as how to adjust an encounter's difficulty.

### Special Traits
Special traits (which appear after a monster's challenge rating but before any actions or reactions) are character&shy;istics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some explanation.

#### Innate Spellcasting
A monster with this innate ability to cast spells has the Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast as its lowest possible level and can't be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no level is given, use the monster's challenge rating.

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a spell might have a "self only" restriction, which means that the spell affects only the caster.

A monster's innate spells can't be swapped out with other spells. If a monster's innate spells don't require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.

#### Spellcasting
A monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and higher (as explained in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.

The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a particular class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Priesthood feature of the priest or the Druid Path feature of the druid.

A monster can cast spells from its list at a higher level if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a creature with the 3rd-level *lightning bolt* spell can cast iti as a higher level spell if such a spell slot is available.

You can change the spells that a monster knows or has prepared, replacing any spell on a monster's spell list with a different spell of the same level and from the same class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating. 

#### Psionics
A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically doesn't require any components to cast its spells.

### Actions
When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the Action section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks
The most common action that a monster will take in combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the "weapon" might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw or tail spike. For more information on the different kinds of attacks, see the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*.

***Creature vs. Target.*** The target of a melee or ranged attack is either one creature or one target, the difference being that a "target" can be a creature or an object

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2 | INTRODUCTION </div>
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PjJ1cuU.jpg' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:-70px; width:770px' />
<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/JH5NQVm.png' style='position:absolute; top:0px; right:-60px; width:900px' />

\pagebreakNum

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Hit.*** any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of an attack hitting a target are described after the *"Hit"* notation. You have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.

***Miss.*** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss that information is presented after the *"Miss:"* notation.

#### Multiattack
A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the Multiattack ability. A creature can't use Multiattack when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition
A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a bow or crossbow.

### Reactions
If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction, this section is absent.

### Limited Usage
Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can be used.

***X/Day.*** The notation "X/Day" means a special ability can be used X number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to use it again.

***Recharge X—Y.*** The notation "Recharge X—Y" means a monster can use a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the monster's turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or long rest.

For example, "Recharge 5-6" means a monster can use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster's turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5-6 on a d6.

***Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.*** This notation means that a monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

> ##### Grapple Rules for Monsters
> Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn't need to make an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless said otherwise.
>
> A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try and escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster's stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster's Strength (Athletics) modifier.

\columnbreak

### Equipment
A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, using the equipment chapter of the 5th edition *Player's Handbook*, and our *Heroes Handbook* for inspiration, and you decide how much of a monster's equip&shy;ment is recoverable after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by someone else, for instance.

If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.

## Legendary Creatures
A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can't. Legendary creatures can take special actions outside their turns, and a few can exert power over their environ&shy;ment, causing extraordinary magical effects to occur in their vicinity.

### Legendary Actions
A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions—called legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. A legendary creature regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. It isn't required to use its legendary actions, and it can't use legendary actions while incapacitated.

### A Legendary Creature's Lair
A legendary creature might have a section of describing its lair and the special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or simply by being present. Not all legendary creatures have lairs. This section only applies to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in their lairs and are most likely to be encountered there.

#### Lair Actions
If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), the creature can use one of its lair action options, or forgo using any of them that round.

#### Regional Effects
The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.

>  **Petrifying Gaze.**  If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. 
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again.  If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. 
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.

## Bog beasts
Bog beasts are large plant-like creatures, <br>often found in temperate marshes of Azeroth. <br>These massive plants may be mistaken for a thick <br>clump of vegetation if not for their vaguely humanoid shapes and surprising mobility.  

***Creatures of Mystery.*** As the name suggests, bog-beasts are massive, shambling monsters that are half plant and half beast, but not much is known about these secretive lords of the swamp, except that they are territorial and rather aggressive.

***Natural Power.*** Explorers have recorded stories of their immense strength and resilience to harm. Bog-beasts use their strength to slam into their enemies, crushing opponents' defenses with their fists and whatever large objects they can throw at them.

***Plant-like Anatomy.*** A bog beast's roots, which grow on the outside of their bodies, are suitable for consumption.

The fungus that also grows on them can be combined with the heart of a panther and the blood of a green dragon to make a truth serum, while dew glands found within the bog beast can be used as a makeshift water sac.

### Timberling
A timberling is a twisted mass of branches, vines, and leaves that lumbers forward, rustling with each step. Its body has a vaguely humanoid shape, standing four feet high and weighing around 50 pounds. They do not speak or understand any known language.

They are normally peaceful creatures that live in harmony with the land, but any sort of disruption (such as pollution) drives them into an unnatural frenzy. An angered timberling attacks anything that moves. Timberlings can be made peaceful again only by removing the source of their discomfort and returning the land to its natural state.

### Thistleshrub
A thistleshrub is a large plant and plant elemental found in Tanaris. These elementals protect the Thistleshrub Valley - these are creatures of living vines, attacking anything that comes near.

It looks like a patch of cactus-like briars that shudders and then begins to move. It forms massive, gnarled arms covered in wicked thorns.

### Swampwalker
Swampwalkers are similar to most timberlings, but are darker green in color. They dwell almost exclusively in swamps, defending their territory from any intruders. A swampwalker is naturally stealthy and usually lurks just under the surface of the water, lashing out at any creature that comes near. 
They particularly loathe fire and go after anyone holding or wielding a flame, no matter how small or inoffensive the flame may seem.

### Tar Creeper
Tar Creepers are elementals made of living tar found around the Lakkari Tar Pits in Un'Goro Crater.

For the duration, that area is difficult terrain for non plant creatures. In addition, each creature of the thistleshrub's choice in that area when the plants appear must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or become restrained. While restrained in this way, the target takes 9 (2d8) piercing damage at the start of their turn. A creature can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check, freeing itself or another entangled creature within reach on a success.

## Dinosaurs
Dinosaurs are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes with a large variety of colorations and markings between them. They roam many regions of Azeroth, including remote mountain valleys, humid jungles, and rugged barren plains.

### Raptor
The raptor is an aggressive theropods predator of great strength and speed. It can run down almost any prey over open ground, pouncing to pull creatures down with its wicked claws and fanged maw.

### Threshadon
A plesiosaurus is a marine dinosaur whose compact body is driven by powerful flippers. Predatory and aggressive, it attacks any creature it encounters. Its flexible neck accounts for a third of its total length, letting it twist in any direction to deliver a powerful bite.

## Ghosts

### Ghost Template
Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves. A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases the spiritual form is somewhat altered.

When a creature becomes a ghost, it retains its statistics except as described below. The ghost loses any trait that assumes a living physiology.

***Type.*** The ghost's type is undead, and it loses any tags. It no longer requires air, food, drink or sleep.

***Speed.*** The ghost loses its original movement speed and gains fly 40 ft. (hover).

***Senses.*** The ghost has darkvision with a radius of 60 ft.

***Damage Resistances.*** The ghost gains resistance to acid, fire, lightning, thunder; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks

***Damage Immunities.*** The ghost gains immunity to cold, necrotic and poison damage.

***Condition Immunities.*** The ghost can't be charmed, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained

***Ethereal Sight.*** The ghost can see 60 ft. into the Spirit World when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn in side an object.

***New Action: Etherealness.*** The ghost enters the Spirit World from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Spirit World, and vise versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.

***Hit Points.*** If the creature already has three or more damage resistances or immunities, its hit points remain unchanged. Otherwise, the creature's hit points are reduced by a multiplier based on its challenge rating. 

Using the Hit Points Based on Challenge Rating table, apply the appropriate multiplier to the creature's hit points to determine ghost's hit point.

#####  Hit Points Based on Challenge Rating
| Creature <br> Challenge Rating  | HP Multiplier |
|:-----------:|:------:|
|  1-10       | x 0.5  |
|  11-16      | x 0.65 |
|  17 or more | x 0.8  |

## Lashers
Lashers are a type of ambulatory plant found in a multitude of areas across Azeroth, Outland and Draenor.

***Unnatural Evolution.*** Many lashers in the Azuremyst Isles were affected by the contamination caused by the Exodar's crash. The mutated tanglers near the Vector Coil appear to have gained a certain degree of sentience as a result of the energy leaking from the crystals, and have learned to create, set, and conceal vicious traps.

***Healing Roots.*** The root trappers of Azuremyst Isle hold restorative medicinal properties in their vines. Through proper treatment, the vines can be broken down into a powerful healing ointment.

### Lasher Spitter
Spitters are large carnivorous plants, similar to lashers, but capable of spitting poison.
 
### Barbed Orchid
Another type of lasher is the orchid lasher, similar to other lashers, but with a particularly large flower. 

### Bloodpetal Flayer
The lashers in Un'Goro Crater are known as bloodpetals and grow in several different varieties. Most of them are covered
in nasty thorns that exude a crippling toxin.

A bloodpetal flayer appears no different than a standard bloodpetal until it enters combat, at which point it becomes apparent that it is quicker and stronger.
A flayer’s vines and thorns swell up with internal fluids, giving it enhanced abilities in combat.

> ##### Radiation Sickness
> This disease affects humanoids and beasts, and spreads quickly to other unaffected creatures once it has taken hold. It contaminates the mind and body of the affected creature, and follows after it in a thick cloud of miasma.
> 
> When a creature comes in direct contact with a radiation source, such as touching radiated fallout, drinking radiated water, or being bitten by a radiated creature, or if a creature spends an hour in an area contaminated by the radiation, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.
> 
> It takes 1d4 days for the sickness to manifest symptoms in an infected creature. Once it does, the creature starts to take on a sickly appearance, with sickly green abscesses spreading across the characters skin.
>
> At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. The saving throw DC increases by 2 for each consecutive success, before resetting once the creature fails the save.
>
> On a failed saving throw, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, up to a maximum of four levels of exhaustion before it stops increasing. As the exhaustion builds, the creature's skin turns increasingly green and calloused.
>
> Once the creature reaches four levels of exhaustion, it gains one randomly determined *indefinite madness*, as described in the 5th Edition *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and the Miasma feature until cured.
>
> The radiation sickness can be cured by spells such as *lesser restoration* or *heal*.

## Makrura
The makrura, also known as lobstrok, are a race of aquatic humanoid lobsters (or more likely crayfish) that live primarily in the sea, but are capable of surviving on land for short periods of time. These crustaceans live in colonies along the shores of Aszeroth and in the deeper oceans.

***Natural Aggression.*** Makrura are  incredibly hostile and will attempt to kill anybody that comes near them. They are often found underwater guarding shipwrecks.  

Makrura fight by grappling an opponent with one pincer and holding it in place while the other pincer tears it apart. Makrura defend their territory aggressively, and they attack murlocs and naga on sight.

***Savory Prey.*** Makrura suffer from the extreme disadvantage of being tasty to many carnivorous races, a fact appreciated all too well by their enemies on both land and sea. While land dwellers sometimes hunt them for food, a makrura’s most hated enemies are murlocs and naga (but especially the latter). 

### Makrura Tidecaller
Even though it is very uncommon, some makrura has an innate capacity for water magic. The makrura tidecallers are shamans who use their magic to attack their enemies and protect their allies.

***Type.*** The mechanical animal's typs is construct, and it loses any tags it might have had.

***Alignment.*** The mechanical animal is unaligned.

***Ability Scores.*** The mechanical animal's ability scores change as follows: Int 3 (-4), Wis 11 (+0), Cha 1 (-5).

***Senses.*** The mechanical animal has darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.

***Condition Immunities.*** The mechanical animal can't be charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, or gain exhaustion levels.

***Languages.*** The mechanical animal loses all languages it might've known, and understand the languages of its creator, but can't speak.

> ##### Crewing a Mechano-tank
> Most mechano-tanks are manual machines that require a pilot to operate, and even autopiloted tanks can be overwritten to work manually for a time.
>
> A creature can use its action to attempt to climb a **piloted** mechano-tank by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed save, the creature expends half its movement and is unable to climb the mechano-tank.
>
> The controls of the mechano-tank is sealed tight behind a hatch. The hatch can be opened with a successful DC 20 Strength check, or broken if dealt 20 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it has an Armor Class (AC 15).
>
> A Small or smaller creature can expend 5 feet of movement to enter an unoccupied mechano-tank. A creature unfamiliar with the controls of tank must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence check to under&shy;stand the controls of the machine before it is able to pilot it and control its actions and movement.
>
> While piloted, the mechano-tanks Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are exchanged with those of the pilot. A piloted tank uses the initiative of its pilot. The pilot must use its action, reaction, and movement to use the machines action options or force it to move to a new location. While a crea&shy;ture is crewing the mechano-tank, it is considered to have full cover cover against any attack made against it from the ground.
>
> Taking control of an **autopiloted** tank requires a successful DC 17 Tinker's Tool Intelligence check. On a successful save, the creature takes control of the tank until the end of the creature's next turn. At which point the shredders failsafes returns, requiring a new save to temporarily take control of it.

## Ogres

<div style='margin-top:240px;'></div>

## Ogres
Ogres are large, brutish humanoids of notable strength native to Draenor. Their society is based on a clan structure, each clan acting independently of the others. 

***Scattered Around the World.*** Following the defeat of the Horde at the end of the Second War, the ogre clans dispersed in all directions. Some escaped through the Dark Portal back to Draenor, some made the difficult journey across the Great Sea to the distacnt continent of Kalimdor, while others remained in the Eastern Kingdoms.

***Formidable Apperance.***  For an ogre the most important physical attribute is size. Since they prefer to show off their physique, ogres eschew garments that cover too much skin. 

Sometimes, if they want to look more fearsome to their enemies, they adorn their bodies with warpaints created using mortars and pestles.

***Brute Fighters.*** Ogres are straight forward in combat and often suffer as much punishment as they dish out, relying on their strength and stamina to carry them to victory at the battles end.

They are vicious opponents, with the strength to rip off a warrior's limbs should they so choose. The ogres favor huge, spiked clubs that they use to bash in the skulls of their enemies and to bring down the large prey they hunt.

***Two-Headed Ogres and Magic Affinity.*** Ogres are naturally attuned to the arcane. They hold a special affinity for the earth, able to use arcane power to shape and bend rock and stone to their will. Due to the ancient ogres' pra-ctice of sorcery and exposure to raw arcane magic, ogre children would rarely be born with two heads. It soon became clear that these two-headed ogres were exceptional spellcasters, and their appearance was seen as a good omen.

### Ogre Magus
Ogre magi are smarter, spellcasting versions of ogres, who came into existence in the Second War, when the orc warlock Gul'dan carved up the elven Runestone at Caer Darrow and used its mystic powers to imbue Ogre enforcers with the ability and intelligence to cast spells.

### Ogre Lord
Ogre lords are large, two-headed ogres or ogres in unique armor. Although they do not cast spells, ogre lords make up for their lack of magic with pure brawn, blasting their tree-trunk sized clubs into their enemies' skulls with unequaled fury and force.

## Satyrs
The original Satyrs are the descendants of the kaldorei highborne, the first being Xavius, who allied directly with the Burning Legion during the first invasion ten thousand years before the First War.

***Demonic Power.*** Unlike most Highborne who aided the Legion simply to gain access to more magic, those who would become satyr embraced demonic power for its own sake and swore their allegiance to Xavius.

***Ready to Fight.*** Satyrs are organized only loosely, into a variety of sects. When the alarm sounds, all members of a sect throw themselves into battle. Like all demons, when the Legion calls, they scramble to obey.

They are bloodthirsty, depraved individuals who enjoy slicing open their opponents with curved blades and flinging entrails everywhere.

***Mysterious Heritage.*** Although Satyrs are usually thought of as a race of Demons, some unique Satyrs are classified as Humanoids for inexplicable reasons. It is possible that these Satyrs have, somehow, established a spiritual connection with Azeroth, or that they have severed their bond with their demonic masters.

### Satyr Trickster
Among the satyrs are the tricksters, rogues who distinguish themselves. The tricksters show a certain penchant for painful traps and ambushes and they revere and mimic Lord Xavius' manipulations of his enemies. In battle, they prefer sneaking around their enemies and stabbing them in the back, than risking an open fight.

### Satyr Hellcaller
Many members of the Burning Legion are skilled wielders of fel magic, but the hellcallers are satyr warlocks who, rather than summon demons, manipulate the entropic fire of fel power itself. They are larger and more imposing than the common satyrs. In fight, they stand close to their allies, allowing them to benefit from their spells, while they summon green-yellow flames that immolate flesh and consume life.

## Scourge

### Scourge Risen Template
A creature risen by the scourge is any Huge or smaller creature brought back to life by vile necromantic energies. A creature that was never flesh and blood to begin with (such as a construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead) can't be risen under the scourge's control. The following characteristics change or are added to a creature that becomes a scourge risen creature.

***Retained Characteristics.*** The risen retain its Armor Class, hit points, Hit Dice, Strength, Dexterity, Constitu&shy;tion, vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities.

***Lost Characteristics.*** The risen loses its original saving throw and skill bonuses, special senses, and special traits. It loses any action that isn't multiattack or a melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If it has an action or a melee weapon attack that deals some other type of damage, it loses the ability to deal damage of that type, unless the damage comes from a piece of equipment, such as a magic item.


***Type.*** The risen's type is undead, and it loses any tags.

***Alignment.*** The risen is neutral evil.

***Ability Scores.*** The risen's ability scores change as follows: Int 3 (-4), Wis 6 (-2), Cha 5 (-3).

***Senses.*** The risen has darkvision with a radius of 60 ft.

***Damage Immunities.*** The risen gains immunity to poison damage.

***Condition Immunities.*** poisoned.

***Languages.*** The risen understands all languages it knew in life, but cannot speak.

***Attacks.*** If the risen has no other means of dealing damage, it can use its fists or limbs to make unarmed strikes. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + the risen's Strength modifier, increasing by 1d4 for each size larger than Medium.

> ##### Variant: Greater Abomination
> A greater abomination has a challenge rating of 9 (5,000 XP). It has the statistics of an abomination except that it has 152 (16d10 + 62) hit points, Armor Class (AC 17), +10 to hit with its weapon attacks, and gains the following action options.
>
>***Engorge.*** The abomination makes one cleaver attack and places a grappled target in its ribcage. The target becomes restrained, and can use its action to break free by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. While restrained in this way, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the abominations turns. An abomination can have only one creature restrained within its ribcage.
>
> ***Cannibalize.*** The abomination cannibalize the corpse of creature that has been dead for less than 24 hours. Each creature of the abomination's choice that is within 120 feet and can see it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

> ##### Crewing a Shredder
> Most shredders are manual machines that require a pilot to operate, and even autopiloted shredders can be overwritten to work manually for a time.
>
> A creature can use its action to attempt to climb a **piloted** shredder by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failed save, the creature expends half its movement and is unable to climb the shredder.
>
> A Medium or smaller creature can expend 5 feet of movement to enter an unoccupied shredder. A creature unfamiliar with the controls of shredders must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence check to understand the controls of the machine before it is able to pilot it and control its actions and movement.
>
> While piloted, the shredders Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are exchanged with those of the pilot. A piloted shredder uses the initiative of its pilot. The pilot must use its action, reaction, and movement to use the machines action options or force it to move to a new location. While a creature is crewing the shredder, it is considered to have three-quarters cover against any attack made against it from the ground.
>
> Taking control of an **autopiloted** shredder requires a successful DC 14 Tinker's Tool Intelligence check. On a successful save, the creature takes control of the shredder until the end of the creature's next turn. At which point the shredders failsafes returns, requiring a new save to temporarily take control of it.

## Trogg
Troggs are savage creatures, powerfully built with long and muscular arms. They often have beards and their muscle appear to have been carved in stone; it is not rare to see minerals growing out of their flesh. Troggs have an apelike posture, which makes them be associated with troglodytes.

***Fierce and primitive.*** Troggs are often related with Gnomes, since in the recent history they have been burrowed into the lowest levels in Gnomeregan. Troggs are twice the size of a gnome and much physically stronger. They are drived only from primal insticts like hunger and thirst for power, so the biggest and strongest in a tribe often becomes chieftain; it is not rare to see them consume stone and everything they can, including other troggs. They are known to be cunning in battle but without possessing high intelligence they depend instead on their ferocity. There are only a few which are intelligent enough to become spell casters and learn to speak a language like Low Common.

***Undergound creatures.*** Most troggs do not like sunlight and prefere dig tunnels under the earth using their jagged claws or tools made out of rocks, which they use also to make axes, arrows and small utensils.

## Wildkin
The wildkin are serene, powerful creatures, acting as a powerful force for good and a staunch ally of the night elves. They resemble cross between a bear and a horned owl, which explains both their wisdom and ferocity. They act as a powerful force for good and a staunch ally of the night elves.

***Humble Creatures.*** Most wildkin treat peaceful travelers with respect, sometimes coming to their aid or assisting lost visitors out of their forests.

While good-tempered and wise, the wildkin fights fiercely against evildoers, especially undead and the forces of the Burning Legion.

***Elune's Creations.*** Some night elf scholars claim that wildkin are the creation of Elune, that she created them to guard all of her sacred places. They claim that Elune created the first wildkin in the early days of the world to serve as guardians to Cenarius.

But now, many years later, the wildkin have grown more feral, and without the guidance of the goddess, they are confused. They wander without purpose, though many find their way back to the sacred areas that they once were sworn to protect.

### Moonkin
Related to wildkin, moonkin are large, flightless, sapient bird-like creatures, blessed by Elune to spread nature's grace wherever they travel.
