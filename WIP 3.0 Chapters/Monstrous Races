# Chapter 1: Monstrous Adventurers
Heroes come in many shapes and size, some of which are ancient on the face of Azeroth, and others have just recently emerged to offer their assistance. This chapter presents character races that many would consider to be monstrous or directly hostile towards members of either faction. 

If you're the DM, including these races in your campaign is a storytelling opportunity, a chance for you to decide the roles that different peoples play in the tales you weave. 

If you're a player, consult with your DM before using any of the races here. Your DM may say yes or no to you using a race or subrace, or may modify it in some way.

### Racial Traits
The game traits of the monstrous races are unusual in that some of these races have a reduction to an ability score, and some are more or less powerful than the typical races of Azeroth, additional reasons for monstrous races to be used in a campaign with care.
