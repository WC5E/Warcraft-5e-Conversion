# Chapter 4: New Equipment
The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, troll charms, goblin relics, and gnome jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost any&shy;thing imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets, practical swords, and beautiful elven bows.

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount impor&shy;tance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that Azeroth presents.

## Starting Equipment
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and your chosen background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon. armor, and a backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor's adventurous footsteps.
