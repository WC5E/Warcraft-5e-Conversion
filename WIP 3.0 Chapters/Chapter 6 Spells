## Spell Descriptions
The new spells are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Alextrasza’s Fury
*8th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
Your hands burst into flames as you push a roaring wave of fire outward from yourself. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12d6 fire damage and is stunned until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't stunned. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. A creature killed by this spell is reduced to ash.

#### Amplify or Dampen Magic
*4th-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (something of value to the creature)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You manipulate the flow of mana rushing through a creature, if the creature is unwilling you must succeed on a melee spell attack before you can manipulate their flow. When you touch a creature with this spell, you choose which effect you want to affect the creature with for the spells duration.

***Amplify.*** You amplify a creatures magical prowess. The creature takes additional damage when hit by a spell, deals additional damage when casting a spell, and restores additional hit points to a creature with a spell by an amount equal to your spellcasting modifier.

***Dampen.*** You dampen a creatures magical prowess. The creature reduces damage taken by spells, damage dealt by spells, and the number of hit points restored to it by a spell by an amount equal to your spellcasting modifier.

#### Angelic Feather
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You touch one creature within reach, granting it the swiftness of an angelic being. For the duration of the spell, the creature can take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action as a bonus action on its turn.

#### Arcane Barrage
*4th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You manifest three bolts of raw force and launch them at a target within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each bolt. On a hit, a target takes 5d4 force damage and is pushed 10 feet directly away from you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a <br> spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell creates one more bolt for each slot level above 4th.

#### Arcane Blast
*Evocation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You extend your hand and make a burst of arcane energy erupt from a target within range. If the target is a creature it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 force damage. A creature forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration because of this spell, makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), 17th level (4d8).

#### Arcane Explosion
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You draw from the fluctuating arcane near you and burst with a wave of arcane power. Each other creature within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d8 force damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and can use its reactions as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Army of the Dead
*5th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (brain matter from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You voice profane words, and summon an army of the dead to kill and consume everything in its path. A horde of sham&shy;bling corpses appears around you, and disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

Roll initiative for the horde, which has its own turns. You cannot control the horde. It spends its turns pursing and attacking the nearest nonundead to the best of its ability. <br> It will use its Slams action to attack and grapple creatures before moving to occupy its victims’ spaces and engulf them on the next turn with its Flesh-Eating Compulsion feature. If no creatures are within its reach, the horde will use its full movement to approach any nonundead crea&shy;tures it can see or hear. If no such creatures are evident, it will mindlessly follow you until targets present themselves.

When you first cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures that you can see to be ignored by the shambling horde, and which will be unaffected by its Flesh-Eating Compulsion feature. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, the horde remains for 1d6 rounds if it still has hit points, and no longer ignores these creatures.

> ___
> ***Flesh-Eating Compulsion.*** The horde can share a space with another creature. If a creature that is not an un&shy;dead or a construct share a space with the horde at the beginning of the horde's turn, the horde is incapa&shy;citated (ignoring its incapacitated immunity) and the creature is engulfed. While engulfed, the creature is restrained, and it takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage at the start of each of the horde's turns, or 10 (3d6) piercing damage if the horde has half of its hit points or fewer, and the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the shambling death disease. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; A diseased creature can't regain hit points until the disease is cured. For every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 10 (3d6) on a failure. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Engulfed creatures can try to escape by making a DC 18 Strength check as an action. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the shambling horde.
>
> ***Horde.*** The horde can occupy the space of a Large or smaller creature and vice versa, and the horde can move through any opening large enough for a Medium zombie. The horde can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
>
> ***Undead Fortitude.*** If the horde takes damage, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the horde takes no damage instead.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The shambling horde can make up to three Slams attacks, and each attack must be against a different target.
>
> ***Slams.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage, or 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage if the horde has half of its hit points or fewer. If the target is Large or smaller, it is also grappled (escape DC 18).

Shadowy tendrils extend from you and swirl around the throat of a creature you can see within range.

While the undead is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue com&shy;mands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.
