Many of these spells deal with necromancy or demonology, both of which are forbidden by most conclaves of magi. Others are powerful Wizard spells with no real equivalent in the Warcraft universe.

  ## Spell Descriptions
  The new spells are presented in alphabetical order.
  
  #### Alextrasza’s Fury
  *8th-level evocation*
  ___
  - **Casting Time:** 1 action
  - **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
  - **Components:** V, S
  - **Duration:** Instantaneous
  ___
  Your hands burst into flames as you push a roaring wave of fire outward from yourself. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12d6 fire damage and is stunned until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't stunned.

  You imbue a weapon you touch with unholy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon creates an area of darkness <br> in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The bearer of the unholy weapon is immune to this effect. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage on a hit. If the weapon isn’t already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.
  
  As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this <br> spell and cause the weapon to emit a torrent of corrupting shadows. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 necro&shy;tic damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded. At the end of each Of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
