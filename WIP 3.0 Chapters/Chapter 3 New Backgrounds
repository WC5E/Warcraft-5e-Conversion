# Chapter 3: New Backgrounds
### Dark Apothecary
The Royal Apothecary Society (or the Apothecary Society, and abbreviated R.A.S.) is an alchemical society based in the Apothecarium in Undercity. It was created by Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in order to create a new undead plague to wipe out the Scourge. Its members are all Forsaken or other types of undead beings who joined Sylvanas' cause. They are constantly brewing up new plagues and poisons to unleash upon Sylvanas' enemies. The other races of the Horde believe they are working on a remedy to cure their "illness". Members of the Apothecary society are called Apothecaries or Dark Apothecaries.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Investigation.
<br> **Tool Proficiencies:** Alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kit.
<br> **Equipment:** Alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kit, an arm-
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; band with an embroidered flask and crown, a notebook, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a set of black velvet robes, and a pouch containing 15 gp.

#### Feature: R.A.S. Agent
As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society, you have access to a network of supporters and operatives that are working under the official support of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner. Anywhere where you can find Forsaken, you can find the Dark Apothecaries, that can support you with safe houses, assistance in finding information, herbs or alchemical ingredients. This is a two way coin, though, and they might expect you to help them with one or more tasks.

#### Suggested Characteristics
As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society you are probably curious in nature. Whether or not you're looking for a cure or a weapon you are likely to be striving for the better of the Forsaken, albeit not necessary for the Horde. Remember that "better" never means "better for everyone".
Your bond might be associated with other members of the Royal Apothecary Society, or a location or an object that is important to it. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of the Society, but might be more personal in nature.

### Faction Fostered
You were abandoned at birth and found by members of the opposing faction, taken in by a family and raised as a member of their faction. Having had a harsh childhood of being shunned upon by members of the faction, never fully being accepted but merely tolerated in their presence.

You might be a tauren born in the eastern kingdoms, and abandoned by your parents, to be found by human farmers that took you in, nurtured you and raised you as their own, or you may be a human of Theramore, who ran away from your home, to be taken in by orcs and raised as a member of the horde within Orgrimmar, taught how to fight and learn the language of orcs.

They are nonetheless social individuals, many of which greatly appreciate the races they now have grown up with, and stand by their side against their own kin.
