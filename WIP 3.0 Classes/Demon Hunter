## Demon Hunter
*The enemy came into our world, desiring to extinguish all life. They slaughtered our loved ones, razed our homes..  our cities. You could not stop them. So you came to me, nothing but rage and determination left, I taught you that what once tormented you could give you power.*

*Now you know, no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the Burning Legion*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Illidan Stormrage* &nbsp;</div>

A lone night elf clutching a pair of curved blades, peers to the ground as enemies surround him on all sides, before leaping backwards over the heads of his enemies, swinging his swords at one of them in the process.

A blood elf sprints to the distant aid of her allies, a pair of heavy warglaives in her hands, she releases the fel within, leaving a trail of fel in her path as she rushes in inhumane speed to their aid to jump on the nearest enemy.

A heavily built human standing afar as his allies engage a massive demon, in two swift motions he effortlessly slings his warglaives through the air at the demon, making deep gauges in its hide before returning to his firm grasp.

These hunters have sworn their life to a sacred cause, al-though their motivation may vary, demon hunters are one of Azeroths protectors, these agile hunters carry exceptio-nal skill against the foe they face. They wield both mortal strength and the devastating effects of fel magic, carrying out both with extreme precision

### Feared and Revered
Society often shun demon hunters. Most don't understand the sacrifice that they make, therefore, many choose to become outcasts from their societies. Eyes are commonly turned at them when they wade through towns, most distrust and fear them for what they have become.

Even though the world are untrusting of demon hunters, it matters not the the hunter themselves, cause they are protectors of the common folk against threats wishing the destruction of Azeroth, and most importantly demon. They are not righteous like paladins that fight for the Holy Light, or selfless like some rogues and warriors. They are the force who battles evil and although shunned by common folk, their aid is appreciated by experienced fighters.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:540px;'></div>

### Power Granted for a Price
Demon hunters are not trained like warriors are, they are created. It is a harsh and incurable process, leaving scars on the individual that will never heal. Most who attempt to undergo the rites to become a demon hunter end up dying from the horrors of what now possess them, or kills them-selves because of what they have seen. 

At the very core of becoming a demon hunter is the con&shy;sumption of a demon's soul in a ceremony, forever binding it to the demon hunter and suppressing it from taking control through magical inscriptions on the hunters skin, infused with fel. Finishing the binding of soul to the demon hunter by burning out their eyes with a magically imbued blade, forever binding the chaotic soul of the demon to the hunter. Other processes are done to create a demon hunter, slowly creating a fully fleshed demon hunter by removing much of who they were in their past lives.

### Creating a Demon Hunter
As you make your demon hunter character,  consider why your character decided to undergo the deadly rituals. Were your family slaughtered by demons of the Burning Legion? Did you strive for greater power through fel and how to control it? Were you full of rage and anger and wished to put it to use beyond raw strength? Perhaps you went through their rituals unwillingly, and by a miracle survived the demons attempts to take control? Think of the demon hunters that put you through the rituals and did the rites on you, your relationship to them, are you angry at them for what they have done? pleased with their accomplishment?

#### Chaos Flames
*3rd-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You learn to manifest raw flames of fel. You gain a new attack option that you can use in place of any weapon attack. This special attack is a ranged weapon attack with a range of 60/120 feet. You are proficient with it and add your choice of your Dexterity or Intelligence mod&shy;ifiers to its attack and damage rolls. On a successful hit, this special attack deals 1d8 fire damage.

At 11th level, the damage of your Chaos Flames increase to 1d10 fire damage.

#### Fiery Brand
*6th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your metamorphosis empowers the chaos flames you wield. Whenever you hit a creature with a Chaos flame attack granted by your Demon's Bite, the crea&shy;ture must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have dis&shy;advantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

Additionally, while in your metamorphosis, fire damage dealt by chaos flames ignores resistance to fire and treats immunity as resistance for the purpose of damage.

#### Consume Magic
*10th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You are able to interfere with and absorb magic. As an action, you can spend 2 fel points to create the effects of a *dispel magic* spell. When you dispel an effect this way, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice the spell's level + your Intelligence modifier. These hit points remain until you finish your next short or long rest.

#### Fel Barrage
*17th-level Mark of Wrath feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can release a torrent of chaos flames at targets near you. You can use your action and expend 1 to 5 fel points, releasing a barrage of chaos flames at creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you. Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 force damage for each fel point spend, or half as much damage on a successful one.
