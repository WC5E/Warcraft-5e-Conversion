## Warlock
*Imagine what you could do if you led a group of shaman who controlled the source of their powers, instead of begging and scraping for it. Imagine if these shaman had servants who could also fight on your side. Servants who could send your enemies fleeing helplessly in terror. Suck their magic dry as the insects in the summer suck blood.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

*— Gul'dan*  </div>

<div style='margin-top:0px;'></div>

An imp skitters behind her as a young human clad in robes smiles warmly, weaving magical charms into her honeyed words, bending the palace sentinels to her will.

A brutish orc waves his hand in the air, sparking flames of green and red, with a flash of his hand, he hurls a ball of fel infused fire against a night elf.

Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the rough drawn glyphs made in the dirt. A wild eyed forsaken begins a slow chant, as a demonic gate erupts from the ground.

Warlocks and seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through their powerful fel magic and secret grimoires, warlocks delve deep into forbidden magic both subtle and spectacular.

### Dark Arts, Dominance
In the face of demonic powers, most adventurers see death and destruction. Warlocks see opportunity, dominance, and a clear power to it through their dark sorcery. They are voracious spellcasters who enslave demons into doing their bidding. Some hide away in plain sight, presenting as forward-thinking arcanists while secretly dabbling in dark practices. Others practice their arts openly, in sects that quickly grow notorious both far and wide.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:363px'></div>

### Wielders of Fel
Warlocks are the wielders of the destructive fel, a form of magic most associated with demons and the Burning Legion. It is well known for being entropic and extremely chaotic, leading its practice to have been banned in most societies and for its practitioners to work in secrecy. 

Whilst other forms of magic have a natural source, from the wielder or granted to the wielder, fel magic is a bargain. It corrupts the minds of those involved and desecrates the land around them. If their subdued demons were not enough to frighten the common folk, the fear for what these powers can bring would certainly do the trick.

### Delvers of Secrets
Though warlocks are not innately evil, often pledging them&shy;selves to noble causes, their desire to understand these dark powers and hold command over demonic forces does breed mistrust among even even their closest allies. 

Warlocks peer into the Void without hesitation, leverag&shy;ing the chaos they glimpse within to devastating ends in battle—some of their abilities are even fueled by the souls they’ve harvested from their victims. 

They exploit powerful shadow and fel magic to manipu-late and degrade the minds and bodies of their enemies. They employ hellish fires to rain from the skies, immolating their opponents, summoning and commanding indomitable demons from the Twisting Nether to wreak havoc.

### Creating a Warlock
As you create your warlock, think about how and why you decided to delve into the secrets of fel sorcery, one of the greatest and most volatile powers known among mortals. What made you see potential where others would only see death? Were you seduced by the powers promised? Was a deal struck with a demon, or a denizen of the void? 

Perhaps you are part of a sect to whom fel and shadow are but the means to an end, or perhaps a taste was all it took to hurl you into a magical addiction that you are now fighting to overcome. How your dark studies came to be is for you to decide.

#### Optional Rule: Multiclassing
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the *Player's Handbook*, here's what you need to know if you choose warlock as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a warlock.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If warlock isn't your initial class, you gain skill of your choice from the warlock skill proficiencies when you take your first level of warlock.

***Fel Sorcery.*** You can cast spells known or prepared from the Spellcasting class feature using Fel Sorcery spell slots, and vice versa.

#### Quick Build
You can make a warlock quickly by following these sugges&shy;tions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the charlatan background. 

Third, choose the *shadow bolt* and *mage hand* cantrips, along with the 1st level spell *demon skin* and either of the 1st-level spells *drain life* or *witch bolt*.

\columnbreak

## Class Features
As a warlock, you have the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per warlock level

- *(a)* a scholar's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
- two daggers and a belt pouch

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Profane Secrets
*1st-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You have spent long hours researching and practicing forbidden knowledge, gaining the following benefits:
- You can speak, read, and write Eredun.
- You have advantage on Intelligence checks made to recall information about aberrations, fiends, and undead.
- You apply your proficiency bonus when you make a Charisma check while interacting with fiends, or twice your proficiency bonus if you are proficient in the skill.

### Fel Sorcery
*1st-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Your research into forbidden knowledge has given you facility with dark magic. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 for the warlock spell list.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

#### Spell Slots
The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended Fel Sorcery spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell *Witch Bolt*, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br /> your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br /> your Intelligence modifier
</div>

\columnbreak

<br />

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a warlock spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

### Life Tap
*1st-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When you do not have any Fel Sorcery spell slots remaining, you can still cast a spell as though you do. As part of the action to cast the spell, you lose hit points equal to your level plus your Fel Sorcery slot level. For example, a 7th level warlock with 4th level spell slots would spend 11 hit points to cast a 4th level spell.

This damage cannot be resisted, and you cannot use this feature if doing so would reduce you to 0 hit points. You can use this ability once at 1st level, twice at 7th level, three times at 14th level, and any number of times at 20th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Fel Study
*2nd-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Choose your field of study: Study of Affliction, Study of Demonology, or Study of Destruction, each of which is detailed after the class's description. Your choice grants you features at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Demonic Knowledge
*2nd-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Your studies into grimoires of dark knowledge have given you the power to summon demons. You can call upon the principles of the **Grimoire of Servitude** to bind them as your demonic minion or the **Grimoire of Sacrifice** to rip out their demonic core.

Summoning a demon can only be done at the end of a long rest. You can only have one demonic minion or core at a time.

#### Demons Known
You start by knowing how to summon one particular type of demon of your choice. The Demons Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn additional demon types. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose to replace one demon you know. 

Demons and their cores are described in Part I of Appendix C.

#### Grimoire of Sacrifice
Using the Grimoire of Sacrifice, you can destroy a demon when you summon it to obtain its demonic core, the source of its power. A demonic core differs from demon to demon. 

At 2nd level while carrying the core you have advantage on two skill checks. While holding the core, you gain an additional spell or cantrip known. You are able to cast this spell at will. 

As you increase in level, you are able to draw deeper upon the core to cast more powerful spells. At 5th and <br /> 9th levels you gain an additional spell known while <br /> holding the core. You can cast these spells once each without expending a spell slot and regain the ability to <br /> do so when you finish a long rest.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

At level 13 you can consume the core as an action to recharge your own powers, regaining all expended soul shards.

Which skills are affected and spells provided varies based on the demon the core came from. See the Demonic Core section of each demon in Part I of Appendix C for more details.

#### Grimoire of Servitude
Using the Grimoire of Servitude, you can bind a demon into becoming your minion. Your minion acts indepen-dently of you, but it always obeys your commands. See <br /> Part I of Appendix C for the demon's game statistics.

Once summoned, a demonic minion remains until it is slain or dismissed. You can temporarily dismiss your minion as an action. It disappears into a pocket dimension where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

When the minion drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. If the demon has died within the last hour, you can expend a soul shard as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it. The demon returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored. 

In combat, it shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on it's own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide or Search action.

### Soul Shards
*3rd-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can create soul shards: small crystals formed from fragments of souls and spirits. You can expend a soul shard to empower your warlock spells and abilities. You start knowing the abilities listed below and learn more as you gain more levels in the warlock class. 

You can have up to three soul shards at any given time; attempting to create an additional soul shard results in a useless dull gemstone. Soul shards last until used, at which point they disappear. If a soul shard leaves your possession for at least 8 hours, it disappears. Soul shards you create can only be used by you; soul shards created by other warlocks are useless.

Over the course of a rest, you can gather fragments of wandering souls to create soul shards. You can create a single soul shard over the span of a short rest, or any number over a long rest.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:-9px'></div>

> ##### Creature Soul Shards
> Soul shards are only useful if they are created from sufficiently dense spirit energy or complex souls. While some exceptions exist, the following guidelines typically hold true:
> - All humanoids can produce soul shards.
> - Most undead and almost all constructs cannot produce soul shards.
> - All other creature types typically only produce soul shards if their souls are sufficiently complex: i.e., their CRs are 1/8 and above.

Additionally, you can capture part of the escaping souls of nearby dying creatures in the form of soul shards. When an appropriate creature within 60 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to create a single soul shard. 

When you reach 9th level, your maximum number of soul shards increases to five.

What constitutes an appropriate creature is up to a DM's discretion, but a guideline is listed in the **Creature Soul Shards** sidebar. 

You can expend a soul shard within 5 feet of you to create one of the following effects:

***Casting Circle.*** You can expend a soul shard as a bonus action to create a 5-foot radius circle of demonic runes to appear on the ground. As long as you remain in this circle, you have advantage on concentration checks. The circle fades after 1 minute.

***Soulburn: Extend.*** When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 hour or more, you can expend a soul shard to extend the duration by a number of hours equal to your warlock level.

***Soulburn: Quicken.*** When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 10 minutes or less, you can expend a soul shard to cast it as an action instead.

***Soulburn: Rebound.*** When you cast a spell that affects a single target and it has no effect (either due to missing on the attack roll or the target succeeding on their saving throw), you may expend a soul shard as a reaction to redirect it to another target within range.

***Soul Rites.*** You can expend a soul shard to cast any warlock spell with a ritual tag as a ritual as long as you have Fel Sorcery or Nethermancy spell slots of the spell's given level. You do not have to know the spell to cast it as a ritual as long as it is on the warlock spell list.

### Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

<div class='footnote footnote-white'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Soulforging
*5th-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can forge powerful, magical stones from your soul shards. You create a stone by expending a soul shard, which is done as an action. Once a stone has been created, it lasts until used, after which it crumbles to dust. You can only have a single stone of each type created at a time; creating an additional stone will cause the other stone to become inert.

***Firestone.*** You can expend this stone when casting a warlock spell to cause it to deal a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If the spell does not use an attack roll, it instead deals damage as if it were one spell level higher.

***Healthstone.*** You or another creature can crush the healthstone as an action to regain a number of hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your warlock level.

***Soulstone.*** You can expend this stone to cast the *revivify* spell without expending a spell slot or providing material components. If you are reduced to 0 hit points and are carrying a soulstone, it is automatically expended and you are reduced to 1 hit point instead.

***Spellstone.*** You can expend this stone when casting a warlock spell, causing one creature to have disadvantage on its first saving throw made against that spell.

### Nethermancy
*11th-level warlock feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can push yourself to cast more powerful spells a certain number of times per day. You gain a single spell slot of 6th level. This spell slot can be expended to cast any warlock spell you know. You regain any expended Nethermancy spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Whenever you gain a spell slot through Nethermancy, you also learn a single warlock spell of a level that you can cast. These are counted separately from your normal spells, as shown on the Spells Known column of the Warlock table.

At higher levels you earn more spell slots: one 7th level spell slot at 13th level, one 8th level slot at 15th level, and one 9th level slot at 17th level.

When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells gained through Nethermancy and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list.  

## Fel Studies
Warlocks have come into contact with the powerful fel, studying its uncontrollable energy. Three such studies exist, each delving into a different aspect of the powers wielded by warlocks.

### Study of Affliction
Warlocks that study affliction become masters of shadow-touched powers, unlike priests of the shadow priesthood, warlocks delight in the use of fel as a force to cause pain and leaving their enemies in whirls of torment.

#### Expanded Spell List
*2nd-level Study of Affliction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Your area of study lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Affliction Expanded Spells
Spell<br />Level|Spells
--------------|------
1st|✦ *dark void*, *dissonant whispers*
2nd|*blindness/deafness*, ✦ *mind flay*
3rd|*slow*, *stinking cloud*
4th|*confusion*, *elemental bane ^XGE^*
5th|*cloudkill*, *contagion*

#### Corruption
*2nd-level Study of Affliction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can cast Banes, which are powerful curses that can be placed upon creatures. You learn one Bane of your choice, which are detailed under "Banes" below. You learn one additional Bane of your choice, and can choose one of the Banes you know and replace it with another, at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

When you use your Corruption, you choose which Bane to invoke. While invoking a Bane, but before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse by expending a soul shard. An amplified curse gains an additional effect, noted in the curse’s description. If a Bane calls for a saving throw, it uses your warlock spell save DC.

You can use this feature once. Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Corruption feature twice, at 14th level you can use it three times between rests, and at 18th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Haunt
*2nd-level Study of Affliction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When a creature within 60 feet makes a skill check using Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom, you can use your reaction to manifest a demonic presence around it. The creature is haunted, its mind clouded by this presence.
    
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, the skill check also fails. If the target makes another skill check using the same ability score, while haunted, it must repeat the saving throw.

On a successful save, the haunt ends and the skill check is made as normal. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a short rest.

#### Curse Master
*6th-level Study of Affliction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You learn the *bestow curse* and *remove curse* spells. These do not count against the number of spells known listed in the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you cast either of these spells you can target two creatures instead of one.

<div class='footnote footnote-white'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Drain Soul
*10th-level Study of Affliction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When you deal psychic or necrotic damage to a creature, you can generate one soul shard. You can use this ability three times and regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Unstable Afflictions
*14th-level Study of Affliction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When a creature successfully makes a saving throw against one of your warlock spells or abilities, they take an amount of psychic damage equal to half your warlock level.

#### Potent Afflictions
*18th-level Study of Affliction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Choose one of the following options. Once you use either ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

***Curse of Doom.*** You learn a curse of impending doom. As a bonus action, you place the curse on one creature you can see within 60 feet. At the end of each creature's turn, the target creature takes 1d4 psychic damage. This damage increases by 1 for each turn after the first.

After the target takes damage from this curse six times, or when the creature dies, the curse ends and a doomguard appears within 5 feet of the cursed target, or the nearest available space. 

The doomguard acts on the turn immediately after yours and obeys your commands (no action required) for 1 minute or until killed or dismissed as a bonus action, after which it disappears. Doomguards are described in Part II of Appendix C.

***Seed of Corruption.*** You learn how to place a fragment of shadow energy inside a creature, that grows until detonated. As a bonus action, you can place the curse on a creature that you can see within 60 feet. 

The creature takes 1d6 points of psychic damage at the beginning of its turn. This damage increases by 1d6 each turn after the first. The creature can attempt a Wisdom save at the end of its turn, ending the effect when it makes two successful saves. 

When the curse is ended, either by the creature dying or making its save, a number of creatures of your choice within 60 feet up to the number of dice of psychic damage last rolled for this curse must must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or gain one curse of your choice from the spell *bestow curse*. If the cursed target dies as a result of this ability's damage, the creatures have disadvantage on their saving throws.

The same curse must be applied to all affected creatures. This curse lasts for 24 hours unless removed. Attempting to do so requires an ability check against your warlock save spell DC to succeed. 

#### Banes
The banes are presented in alphabetical order.

<div style='margin-top:-5px'></div>

##### Bane of Agony
As a bonus action, you curse a creature you can see within 30 feet, dealing 1d4 points of psychic damage. During each of your turns for the next minute, you can use your bonus action to deal 1d4 psychic damage to the creature. This damage increases as you level: 2d4 at 5th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 17th level. The creature can attempt a Wisdom save at the beginning of its turn, ending the effect on a success.

***Amplify.*** When the target is damaged by the Bane, it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

##### Bane of the Elements
When a creature you can see within 30 feet is hit with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to temporarily weaken their resilience against it. Until the end of the turn, the target loses their resistance to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell.

***Amplify.*** The target instead loses immunity to the damage types of the triggering attack or spell, having resistance to them until the end of the turn.

##### Bane of Exhaustion
As a bonus action, you can attempt to exhaust a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have their speed be reduced to 0 and they can’t use reactions until the end of your next turn.

***Amplify.*** This curse lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.

##### Bane of Fragility
As a bonus action, you can attempt to curse a creature you can see within 30 feet. The creature cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn. Additionally, any temporary hit points it possesses are removed. When the effect ends, it regains any temporary hit points it possessed.

***Amplify.*** The curse lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, this curse ends.

##### Bane of Recklessness
When a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to cause them to attack recklessly. Until the beginning of its next turn, attacks against the creature have advantage.

***Amplify.*** For 1 minute, the target cannot use the Disengage, Dodge, or Hide actions. The creature can attempt a Wisdom save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

##### Bane of Shadows
As a bonus action, you curse a creature you can see within 30 feet until the beginning of your next turn. The first time in a turn that the creature is damaged, it takes an additional 1d8 points of necrotic damage. When the creature takes this extra damage, it can can attempt a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC, ending the effect on a success.

***Amplify.*** The curse lasts for 1 minute.

##### Bane of Tongues
When a creature you can see within 30 feet attempts to cast a spell with a vocal component, you can use your reaction to try to disrupt it with a curse. The creature must use its own reaction to succeed in casting the spell. Until the end of the creature's next turn, it is unable to speak any language it knows.

***Amplify.*** The curse lasts for 1 minute. The creature must use either a bonus action or reaction each time it attempts to cast a spell or the spell fails and is wasted. The creature can attempt an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum
##### Bane of Weakness
As a bonus action, you curse a creature you can see within 30 feet until the beginning of your next turn. Whenever the creature hits with a weapon attack, it rolls twice for damage and takes the lower result.

***Amplify.*** The curse lasts for 1 minute. The creature can attempt an Constitution saving throw at the beginning of your turn, ending the effect on a success.

### Study of Demonology
Warlocks that study demonology harness the powers of the malefic demon beings of the twisting nether. Uncovering secrets unknown by residents of Azeroth, and twisting their magic with the aid of demonic powers from the great dark.

#### Expanded Spell List
*2nd-level Study of Demonology feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

3rd|*magic circle*, *spirit guardians*
4th|*dimension door*, *dominate beast*
5th|*infernal calling ^XGE^*, *planar binding*

#### Soul Conduit
*2nd-level Study of Demonology feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Your studies into demonology allow you to form a stronger bond between you and your demonic minions. You can communicate telepathically with your minion as long as you are on the same plane of existence.

Additionally, as an action, you can see through its eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the demon has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.

While perceiving through your minion's senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your companion is normally incapable of speech.

Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your demon companion can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your companion must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll.

#### Sense Demons
*2nd-level Study of Demonology feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You gain the ability to sense the presence of demons due to your sensitivity to demonic energies. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect demons. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any demon within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity.

\columnbreak

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Soul Link
*6th-level Study of Demonology feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

While the demon is within 60 feet of you, half<br /> of any damage you take (rounded up) is transferred to the demonic companion.

Additionally, your demon companion can use its reaction in place of yours to generate a soul shard.

#### Demonic Fury
*10th-level Study of Demonology feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You gain a pool of energy you can use to empower your demon. You have six points that you can use to gain one of the following effects, and you regain any expended points when you finish a long rest:
- When you command your demon to take the Attack action, you can spend a point to give them advantage on the attack roll.
- When your demon is forced to make a saving throw, you can spend a point as a reaction to give them advantage on the roll.

#### Grimoire of Supremacy
*14th-level Study of Demonology feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You call upon the knowledge of the Grimoire of Supremacy to permanently evolve your demonic minion into a more powerful form. It gains a number of benefits as mentioned in its entry in Part I of Appendix C.

#### We Are Legion
*18th-level Study of Demonology feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You apply the teachings of the Grimoire of Supremacy to yourself, permanently transforming yourself into a demon. You can gain two or more quirks from the Metamorphosis Quirks table (or come up with similar quirks) and the following abilities: 

- You sprout wings that grant you a fly speed equal to your movement speed. You can hide or unhide these wings as a bonus action.
- You gain resistance to fire and necrotic damage.

### Study of Destruction
Warlocks that study destruction meddle with the metaphysical concept of destruction, willing to suffer backlash if they are better able to wreak havoc upon their enemies. They are happy to revel in the destruction they cause, thrilled at any opportunity to watch the world erupt in discord.

#### Expanded Spell List
*2nd-level Study of Destruction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

Your area of study lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

##### Destruction Expanded Spells
Spell<br />Level|Spells
--------------|------
1st|*burning hands*, *chaos bolt ^XGE^*
2nd|*flaming sphere*, *shatter*

5th|*destructive wave*, *flame strike*

#### Pyrophile

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You learn the *produce flame* cantrip, which you treat as a warlock cantrip and does not count against your cantrips known. 

Additionally, you can magically ignite a flammable object you touch with your hand as an action.

#### Channel Demonfire
*2nd-level Study of Destruction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can channel the double-edged power of hellfire into your spells. When you deal damage with a warlock spell, you can choose to take an amount of fire damage up to your warlock level. One target takes twice as much fire damage as you took. 

#### Havoc
*6th-level Study of Destruction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When you cast a warlock spell using a Fel Sorcery spell slot that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can expend a soul shard to target a second creature in range with the same spell.

#### Unending Resolve
*10th-level Study of Destruction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).

#### Flames of Xerrath
*14th-level Study of Destruction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can overcharge the power of your spells with the power of fel flames. When you deal damage with a warlock spell cast using a Fel Sorcery spell slot, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

\columnbreak

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 5d12 fire damage at the end of the current turn. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the fire damage increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. 

#### Inferno
*18th-level Study of Destruction feature*

<div style='margin-top:-4px'></div>

You can conjure a meteor from the Twisting Nether as an action, causing it to appear in the air and crash down to a point you designate within 60 feet. 

Creatures in a 30 feet radius of that point take 2d8 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage and the ground becomes difficult terrain. You can then choose to either detonate the stone, dealing 13d10 fire damage to all creatures within 30 feet of the point (Dexterity save for half damage), or you can animate it as an infernal. Infernals are described in Part II of Appendix C.

The infernal rises from the crater at the end of your turn, following your commands (no action). It remains animated for 1 minute, or until killed or dismissed as a bonus action. When you dismiss the infernal, you can choose whether to merely dismiss it or force it to use its Death Burst ability. 

Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Spell Descriptions

*8th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of charcoal)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You cause the ground to crack and split, with molten magma and fire spitting up out in a 60-foot radius centered on a point within range. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 10d6 fire damage, taking half damage on a success.

A creature who takes fire damage from this spell is set aflame, taking an additional 2d6 fire damage at the beginning of each of their turns. They or another adjacent creature can use their action to put out the flames, taking 1d4 fire damage in the process.

The ground in the area of this spell remains damaged, turning into difficult terrain. It remains hot for 1 minute, and any creature who enters the area for the first time on their turn or starts their turn there takes 1d4 fire damage.

#### Dark Void
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You grasp the fabric around a target within range, pulling necromantic energies from it and creatures of your choice within 5 feet of it. A target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d4 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st

\columnbreak
#### Demon Skin
*1st-level transmutation*
___

*Necromancy cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Up to 1 hour
___
This spell channels a small amount of dark energy. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
- Choose a point within 30 feet. In a 5-foot radius of that point, bright light becomes dim light, and dim light becomes darkness for 1 hour. Any light sources within the area have the light they produce suppressed for the duration.
- An object up to 1 cubic foot in size or an area up to 1 square foot that you touch lightly decays. Wood rots, glass cracks, flowers wilt. Casting the spell and then continuing to touch the target advances the decay; after 1 minute, the target is destroyed. This spell cannot affect creatures, magical objects, or sturdy materials like metal and stone.
- You can reanimate a Tiny 0 CR beast for 1 hour. It is undead and obeys all of your commands to the best of it's abilities, though it cannot attack. You cannot use this effect again until the reanimated creature dies, or the effect ends.
- You instantaneously light a candle, torch, or small campfire. The fire glows your choice of a smoldering red, bright green, or shadowy purple until extinguished.
- Your fingertip glows green or purple for up to 1 minute. While it glows, you can use your finger to draw glowing lines of the same color on a solid surface that last for 1 hour.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

You cause a green stream of energy to trail from the target creature's eyes and mouth and into your hand, forming a continuous stream of energy to bind you two together.

On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d8 necrotic damage to the target automatically. Each time the target takes damage from this spell, you gain a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt and their maximum hit point total is reduced by the same amount. This reduction lasts until they finish a long rest.

The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or if it has total cover from you. This spell has no effect on the creature if they are a construct or undead.
