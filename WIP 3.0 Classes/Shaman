## Shaman
*The wolves are not tamed, not as you might understand the word. They have come to be our friends because I invited them. It is a part of being a shaman. We have a bond with the things of the natural world, and strive always to work in harmony with them. Warlocks would term them spells, but we shamans simply term them calls. We ask, the powers we work with answer. Or not, as they will. I can call the snows, and wind, and lightning. The trees may bend to me when I ask. The rivers may flow where I ask them to.*
<div style="text-align:Right">

*— Drek'Thar of the Frostwolf clan*  </div>

An orc clad in loose plates chained together stands atop a lonely peak, the winds picking up around him, rattling through the chains of his armor, before he releases a glist&shy;ening bolt of lightning toward his enemies.

A gray haired dwarf slowly lumps his way across the battlefield, emptying a bottle of water into the earth as he walks, before lifting it from the soil, and gently waves it over the body of a wounded ally, soothing his grave wounds.

A human sprinting through the thicket, a pair of massive wolves of spectral vision running at his side. In the flash of a moment he howls as his body turns into a wolf of similar visage to his pets.

Shamans are mortal mediators between the elements themselves. Often a spiritual guide in their community, these mystical figures may commune with ancestral spirits and weave elemental powers into their spells. Both to strengthen and heal their allies, and to strike down on the battlefield with devestating force. Shamans can imbue their weapons with the elements, smite their enemies with storm and fire, and summon forth elementals to their aid.

<div style='margin-top:340px;'></div>

### Herald of the Elements
A Shaman's bond to their magic is unique. While a mage would study it in great depth, and a warlock would bend those same power to their whim, a shaman calls upon the elements themselves for aid. They commune with forces not strictly benevolent -- sometimes they may respond, and sometimes they may choose not to. The elements are chaotic, chained away in their elemental plane as they rage against one another with unending primal fury. It is the call of the shaman to bring balance to this chaos.

These masters of the elements can also call upon ele&shy;mental forces directly, unleashing torrents of lava and bolts of lightning against foes. The elements can create, destroy, support, and hinder. An experienced shaman balances the vast spectrum of these primordial forces into an array of diverse abilities, making shaman versatile adventurers and valued members of any group.

### Respected and Feared
Since the early days of mortal life both Azeroth and Draenor, the elements of have been both feared and wor&shy;shiped. Mystics have sought to commune with them, to tap into the raw power of earth, air, fire, and water. In time, these spiritual guides have come to understand that the depth and gravity of the powers they wield. That the ele&shy;ments are not wholly benevolent, but rather a torrent of neverending conflict, as the elemental lord vie for control. The calling of the shaman is as a conduit of these volatile energies, leveraging them both to heal and to harm.

### Creating a Shaman
When creating a  shaman, consider how your bond with the elements have affected your personality and your view of the world. Although shamans resonate with all four primary elements, some tend to outwardly display aspects of one over the rest. 

Shamans who lean towards fire might be impatient, temperamental, or bursting with energy in all they do. Shamans who lean toward water are adaptable, chaotic, and tend to go with the flow. 

Those who favor earth are typically lawful, stalwart, and stubborn. And shaman who favor air are often aloof, distant, and  the most neutral in their arbitrations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about your bond with your totems and how they represent the elemental planes from which you gain your power. Are they simply tools to you for channelling raw planar power, or are they sacred and worthy of reverence? 

Do they act as representations of a favored element, or do you use them to keep that element in check? How a shaman perceives their connection to the elemental planes is often reflected in the totems they summon forth.

#### Optional Rule: Multiclassing
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the *Player's Handbook*, here's what you need to know if you choose shaman as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a shaman.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If shaman isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a shaman: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons.

***Spell Slots.*** Add your levels in the shaman class (or half your levels if you choose the Enhancement subclass) to the appropriate levels from other class to determine your available spell slots.

\columnbreak

#### Quick Build
You can make a shaman quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. If you intend to engage in melee combat regularly, make Strength or Dexterity your second highest ability score instead.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
 - *(a)* hide armor or *(b)* leather armor
 - *(a)* a mace and shield or *(b)* two simple weapons
 - *(a)* a dungeoneer's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
 - a druidic focus

<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

### Kalimag
You know Kalimag, the language of elementals. You can speak the language and use it to leave messages in rocks and pools of water that only you and other shamans spot. The messages are spoken as through a *sending* spell, with the limitations that come of that spell.
<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

### Spellcasting
Drawing on the elements themselves, you can manifest them into casting spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the shaman spell list.

#### Cantrips
You know two cantrips of your choice from the shaman spell list. You learn additional shaman cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table.

#### Spell Slots
The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a spell slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the shaman spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Shaman table shows when you learn more shaman spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the shaman spells you know and replace it with another spell from the shaman spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, since your power comes from the elements and spirits. You use your Wisdom whenever a shaman spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a shaman spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells.

\columnbreak

### Totemist
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to channel elemental forces into a Small totem in an empty space on a horizontal surface within 15 feet of you. 

The totem is a magical object that occupies its space. It has an AC of 15 and a number of hit points equal to twice your shaman level. It is immune to poison damage, psychic damage, and all conditions. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). The totem disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 minute. You can dismiss it early as a bonus action.

You can use your reaction to cause the totem to activate if you are within 60 feet of it and choose one of its powers to take effect. Your totem starts with two such powers: Elemental Resistance and a power determined by your Elemental Attunement. Your totem gains an additional power at 3rd level, determined by your shamanic binding.

You can use your Totemist feature twice between rests. You regain all spent uses after finishing a short or long rest. You can summon an additional totem between rests when you reach 10th level, and again at 18th level.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

***Totem Power: Elemental Resistance.*** You can activate the totem when a creature within 15 feet it takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, giving them resistance to that type of damage until the end of their next turn.

### Elemental Attunement
Starting at 2nd level, you attune yourself to a force of the elemental plane. Choose one of the following options. You cannot take an Elemental Attunement option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. 

#### Attunement of Air
Your movement speed is increased by 5 feet and you may add your proficiency bonus to your initiative.

At 9th level, you gain resistance to lightning damage.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

***Totem Power: Grace of Air.*** You can activate the totem when a creature within 15 ft. of it makes a Dexterity check or saving throw, giving them advantage on their roll.

#### Attunement of Earth
You gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.

At 9th level, you gain resistance to acid damage.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

***Totem Power: Strength of Earth.*** You can activate the totem when a creature within 15 ft. of it makes a Strength check or saving throw, giving them advantage on their roll

#### Attunement of Fire
When you hit a creature with an attack roll that is unable to hit more than one creature, you may deal additional fire damage to it equal to your profici&shy;ency bonus. You may use this attunement once per turn.

At 9th level, you gain resistance to fire damage.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

***Totem Power: Flametongue.*** You can activate the totem when a creature within 15 ft. of it makes a Charisma check or saving throw, giving them advantage on their roll.

#### Attunement of Water
You know a number of additional shaman spells of 1st level or higher equal to your proficiency bonus.

At 9th level, you gain resistance to cold damage.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

***Totem Power: Cleansing Stream.*** You can activate the totem when a creature within 15 ft. of it makes a Wisdom check or saving throw, giving them advantage on their roll.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

### Shamanic Binding
At 3rd level, you choose a shamanic binding, shaping your approach to the forces of the elements. Choose Elemental, Enhancement, or Restoration, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 14th, and 20th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Spirit Beast
At 5th level, you earn the favor of a spirit beast and are able to assume its spectral visage. Choose a Medium or Small beast without a fly or swim speed to represent your spirit.

You can use your action to assume the illusionary visage of your spirit beast. This visage has no effect on your game statistics except changing your movement speed to 50 feet.

You remain transformed until you cast a spell, make an attack, or use your bonus action to revert back to yourself.

### Totemic Projection
At 10th level, you are able to channel elemental forces into a totem at greater lengths, increasing the distance at which you can summon your totem to 30 feet and while you are within 60 feet of your totem, you may use a bonus action to move the totem to an empty space within range as if you had summoned it anew.

Additionally, you are able to manifest simple yet effective spells through your totem. You can use your action to cast a shaman cantrip with a range of 5 feet or more through the totem, as though you were in space of the totem.

### Far Sight
Beginning at 13th level, you are able to hone your sight and focus it upon a creature that you have seen before. By performing a 10 minute ritual, you can attempt to cast the *scrying* spell without providing material components. Roll a percentile dice, if the result is less than your Shaman level, you cast the *scrying* spell.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Shamanic Binding
Shamans strive to deepen their understanding and connec&shy;tion with the elements, often forming a bond with it for life. Some prefer a more brutal approach as they rein in the powers of fire and earth for physical combat, or the forces of fire and air to fight at range. Others in turn, prefer a subtle approach of peace and meditation, bending water and air to their will. You attune with one of these groups.

### Elemental
Through careful study and dedication, elemental shamans are able to channel the volatile energy of the Elemental Plane into destructive magical surges. Through their body flows bolts of lightning, as if from storm, and bursts of fire, as if from molten earth. To battle an elemental shaman is to taunt the very forces of nature.

#### Totem Power
When you choose this binding at 3rd level, you gain the following Totem Power.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

***Totem Power: Tranquil Mind.*** You can activate the totem when a creature within 15 feet of it is forced to make a Constitution saving throw to main&shy;tain concentration, giving them advantage on the saving throw.

#### Elemental Fury
Starting at 3rd level, when you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can subsitute that damage type with one other type from the list (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). 

#### Binding Spells
Your attunement to the Elemental Plane infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. You learn additional spells connected to your Elemental Attunement when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in your elements Spell table. The spell counts as a shaman spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of shaman spells you know. These spells can’t be replaced when you gain a level in this class.

#### Echo of the Elements
At 6th level, when you roll damage for a shaman spell, you may reroll a number of dice up to your Wisdom modifier and use either roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Primal Sanctuary
Upon reaching 14th level, elemental creatures of the world sense your connection the Elemental Plane and become hesitant to attack you. When an elemental creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your shaman spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack auto&shy;matically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

#### Ascendance
At 20th level, you can assume the form of an elemental ascendant. Using your action, you undergo a transforma&shy;tion. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits.

- You gain immunity to damage dealt by the damage type of your elemental attunement.
- When you reroll a dice with your Echo of the Elements feature, you add both dice results to the spell's damage.
- You can use your reaction when hit by a melee attack to cause the attacker to take damage of your elemental attunement's type equal to your shaman level.

***Weapon Strikes.*** You know two weapon strikes of your choice, which are detailed under "Weapon Strikes" below. Weapon strikes enhance an attack in some way. You can only use one strike per attack unless otherwise noted.

You learn an additional weapon strike of your choice at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Each time you learn a new weapon strike, you can also replace one weapon strike you know with a different one.

***Saving Throws.*** Some of your strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the strike's effect. The saving throw DC is equal to your spell save DC.

#### Extra Attack

### Restoration
Some shaman find serenity in the restorative properties of water. They do not seek the Light or turn to the divine, yet they feel a profound spiritual connection to the source of mortal life. So strong is their connection to water that the shaman may draw on its power to restore life and heal afflictions, like a tidal wave across a sandy shore. They balance their charge with the other elements, striving for balance and harmony.

#### Totem Power
When you choose this binding at 3rd level, you gain the following Totem Power.
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

#### Ancestral Guidance
Starting at 3rd level, your restorative spells are guided by the hand of your ancestors. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature and roll a 1 or 2, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

#### Nullifying Forces
At 6th level, you are able to draw upon the elements to disrupt the spellwork of others. When you cast a spell that targets a friendly creature, you may also attempt to end one spell effect that is currently affecting them. If the spell slot of the effect is of equal or lower level than spell slot of your spell, the effect ends. Otherwise you must make a Wisdom check (DC 10 + the spell's level) to end it.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

***Earth.*** The creature can call upon this boon when it is hit by an attack, gaining a number of temporary hit points equal to your shaman level. These hit points last until the end of the creature's next turn.

***Fire.*** The creature can call upon this boon when it is hit by a melee attack, to wreathe the attacking creature in fire. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take fire damage equal to your shaman level.
