## Priest
*It is faith in ourselves that separates us from others, and with our powers, we will cause great change in all of Azeroth. The weak will come to lean on you. The lepers will call you Lord. And the ignorant will look to you for guidance.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Dark Cleric Duesten* &nbsp;</div>

Bend down over her falling ally, a dwarf clutches her holy symbol, and begins to sing a slow melodic tune, holy light shining from her hand, covering her allies limp body.

Kneeling on the ground, one hand firmly grasping a staff, the other filled with swirls of divine and necrotic energies. A human raises, and sends out a thick halo of light and dark energy out around him, his allies gaining new life, his enemies feeling the rush of necrotic through their bodies.

A forsaken, surrounded in voidic energy pulls his holy symbol from his neck as void covers his body. Tentacles sprouting from his back, as he sends out a laughter, spew-ing bolts of necrotic energy towards enemies and allies.

Priests are the bridge between light and dark, they are the wielders of the warmth holy light of the divine, and the voidic magic granted by the old gods. They serve as protectors, healers, and casters of insanity.w

### Invokers of Light and Darkness
Priests are devoted to the spiritual, and express their unwavering faith by serving the people. For millennia they have left behind the confines of their temples and the comfort of their shrines so they can support their allies in war-torn lands. In the midst of terrible conflict, no hero questions the value of the priestly orders. These masters of the healing arts keep their companions fighting far beyond their normal capacities with an array of restorative powers and blessings. The divine forces at the priest’s command can also be turned against foes.

As light cannot exist without darkness, and darkness without light, some priests tap into shadow to better understand their own abilities, as well as the abilities of those who threaten them.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:522px;'></div>

### Devoted Acolytes
Priests practice a complex, organized form of spirituality built around moral philosophy, the worship of a particular deity (such as Elune) in some cases, and/or idol worship, rather than around the reverence of the elements that shamans practice, or the close divine connection with animals and the wilderness that druids maintain. Priests serve not only as influential religious figures in their respective societies, but also as powerful practitioners of divine magic, which they use to heal and protect, or harm and weaken.

Devotion to the faiths of Azeroth leads many priests to the paths of courage and heroism. In dark times, priests carry the Light of faith with them as a reminder of the powerful forces at work beyond the comprehension of the peoples who walk the land. Powerful healers with an intimate connection to the divine, priests are empowered with abilities that aid them in times of dire need.

### Creating a Priest
Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the holy light?, a disciplined priest, in beautiful robes, monitoring a sept? or are you an unholy priest of shadows, fallen either by choice or forcefully towards the necrotic arts?

How did you enter priesthood? Were you raised in a mo-nastery? Did you hear a whisper from the light itself telling you to serve it? Or did a terrible war force you to take up the warmth of the holy light to assist your allies? Perhaps you might have known from your earliest memories that the priest's life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As guardians against forces of wickedness and evil, priests are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and soothing, or did you never feel the warmth of the holy light, and instead felt the calling of the old gods? their voidic magic wrapping around you, making your actions chaotic?

#### Quick Build
You can make a priest quickly by following these sugges&shy;tions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.

#### Optional Rule: Multiclassing
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the *Player's Handbook*, here's what you need to know if you choose priest as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Charisma score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a priest.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If priest isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a priest: one skill from the class's skill list.

***Spell Slots.*** Add your levels in the priest class to the appropriate levels from other class to determine your available spell slots.

\columnbreak

## Class Features
As a priest, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d6 per priest level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per priest level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Armor:** None
- **Weapons:** All simple weapons
- **Tools:** Herbalism kit
___
- **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
- **Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
 - *(a)* a mace or *(b)* a quarterstaff
 - *(a)* a priest's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
 - a holy symbol, herbalism kit, and two daggers

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

<div style='margin-top:160px;'></div>

### Spellcasting
As a conduit for divine power. you can cast priest spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the priest spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the priest spell list. You learn additional priest cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Priest table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Priest table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of priest spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the priest spell list. When you do so choose a number of priest spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your priest level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level priest, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of priest spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your priest spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a priest spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a priest spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Charisma modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a priest spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your priest spells.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:160px;'></div>

### Divine Calling
Choose a divine calling, a path of priesthood that you have devoted yourself to: Discipline, Holiness or Shadow, each calling is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 20th level.

#### Calling Spells
Each calling has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the calling descrip&shy;tion. Once you gain access to a calling spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain a calling spell that doesn't appear on the priest spell list, the spell is considered a priest spell for you.

### Echoes of Faith
At 2nd level, the force of your calling echoes through you. This echoing force is represented by faith points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

#### Faith Points
You have 2 faith points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Faith Points column of the Priest table. You can never have more faith points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent faith points when you finish a long rest.

#### Devotion
You can use your faith points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional faith points. You learn other ways to use your faith points as you reach higher levels.

***Creating Spell Slots.*** You can transform unexpended faith points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating spell slot of a given level. You can create spell <br> slots no higher in level than 5th.

***Converting a Spell Slot to Faith Points.*** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of faith points equal to the slot's level.

##### Creating Spell Slots
| Spell Slot Level | Faith Point Cost |
|:----:|:-------:|
| 1st  | 2 |
| 2nd  | 3 |
| 3rd  | 5 |
| 4th  | 6 |
| 5th  | 7 |

\pagebreakNum

### Absolution
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel your faith into absolutions weaved with magical effects. You start with two such effects: Shackle Undead and an effect determined by your calling.

Some Power Word effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest spell save DC.

#### Absolution: Shackle Undead
As an action, you spend 3 faith points and present your holy symbol. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is stunned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Faithful Restoration
Starting at 5th level, you regain 2 faith points whenever you finish a short rest. 

The number of faith points you regain increases to 3 at 10th level, and 4 faith points at 17th level.

\columnbreak

## Divine Calling
Priests choose a divine calling, a path of priesthood that they follow. This calling could be the Church of the Holy Light, the goddess Elune, or a sect dedicated to the dark shadows and void. Your choice might correspond to a particular branch of the divine callings, it could simply be a matter of personal preference, following the purpose that appeals to you the most.

### Discipline
Some priests pride themselves on pragmatism. They understand that light casts a shadow, that darkness is defined by light, and that true discipline stems from one’s ability to balance these opposing powers in services of a greater cause. While these priests possess many holy virtues to aid their allies, they also dabble in the dark arts to debilitate their enemies.

##### Discipline Calling Spells
| Priest Level | Spells               |
|:---:|:------------------------------|
| 1st | cure wounds, inflict wounds   |
| 3rd | darkness, silence             |
| 5th | ✦ divine star, vampiric touch   |
| 7th | death ward, guardian of faith |
| 9th | contagion, wall of force      |
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

*✦ New spells can be found in chapter 6 later in this book* 

#### Bonus Cantrip
Starting at 1st level, you learn one additional priest cantrip of your choice, this cantrip does not count against your number of priest cantrips known.

#### 1st LEVEL FEATURE
Feature here

#### Absolution: Penance
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Absolution to burst out an expanse of radiance or necrotic force.

You can spend up to five faith points as an action and release a penancing volley towards a target you can see within 60 feet of you. When done, you choose whether you want to commend or condemn that target.

***Commend.*** The target regains hit points equal 2 + 1d6 for each faith point spent. If this restores a creature to its hit point maximum, it gains temporary hit points equal to the number of hit points that remain in the pool.

***Condemn.*** The target takes radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to 1d10 for each faith point spent, and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

\pagebreakNum

#### Pain Suppression
Beginning at 6th level, your disciplined mind is capable of projecting a suppressive barrier for your allies' protection.

As a bonus action, you can grant a barrier to a friendly creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. The barrier is invisible. Any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2 + your proficiency bonus. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.
<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

#### Castigation
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage, choose one creature damaged by that spell on the round you cast it. That creature takes extra radiant or ne&shy;crotic damage (your choice) equal to half your priest level. This feature can be used only once per casting of a spell.
<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

#### Clarity of Will
At 20th level, you are able to harness your focused will, improving your Pain Suppression. Your suppression barrier now reduces all damage taken.

While a creature is under the effect of your suppression barrier, it also has advantage on saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened.
<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

### Holy
The most adept priests leave their houses of worship to serve on the battlefield, as shepherd to flock. There, they use their holy powers to bless allies and mend wounds.  And while most stay behind the frontlines to aid their comrades, these holy champions are also capable of smiting foes and carrying out sacred justice.
<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

##### Holy Calling Spells
| Priest Level | Spells                      |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------|
| 1st | bless, cure wounds |
| 3rd | lesser restoration, ✦ shining force |
| 5th | beacon of hope, revivify |
| 7th | death ward, divination |
| 9th | mass cure wounds, raise dead |
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

*✦ New spells can be found in chapter 6 later in this book* 

#### Bonus Proficiency
Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency in religion if you don't already have it and your proficiency bonus doubles for any ability check you make with it.
<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

#### Divine Hymn
At 1st level, you can use your action and present your holy symbol to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your priest level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

#### Healing Prayer
At 6th level, the divine enery of your faith can empower healing spells. Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 faith point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren't incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.

#### Holy Nova
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal radiant damage to the attacker. The damage equals your priest level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your priest spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.

#### Guardian Spirit
At 20th level, you can call upon a spirit to guide a fallen ally back to  their body. When a creature within 60 feet of you dies, you can use your reaction to return them to live before their spirit leaves for the shadowlands. The target is imme&shy;diately returned to life and healed for half of their hit point maximum. The target also gains immunity towards all damage until the start of their next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Shadow
The brightest light casts the darkest shadow -- and from within this blackness, a rival power dwells. Shadow priests fully embrace this opposing polarity, their faith equally resolute as their holy counterparts. Like all priests, they dedicate much of their lives to worship -- but they derive their power from the Void, straying dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods.

#### Psychic Voice
Starting at 1st level, you are able to pierce the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to under&shy;stand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

#### Legacy of the Void
Also at 1st level, when you damage a creature with a priest cantrip, you may deal additional psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you use this feature, you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10 + 1 for each additional use of this feature since your last long rest). On a failed save, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

#### Shadowform
Beginning at 6th level, you can invoke the dark corruption laying dormant within you.

As a bonus action, you can magically shroud yourself in shadow. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
 - If you are not wearing any armor, you add your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.
 - A creature takes necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier when it hits you with a melee attack or if it touches you. 
 - You spells ignores resistance towards necrotic and psychic damage, and creatures immune to necrotic damage are considered resistant.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Dominant Mind
Upon reaching 14th level, you can use your telepathic voice to overwhelm the minds of others. As an action, you can spend 6 faith points to cast *dominate beast* or *dominate person* on a creature within 30 feet of you. 

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.

#### Surrender to Madness
At 20th level, you can embrace the mad whispers of the void and let their powers flow through you.

When you use your bonus action to shroud yourself in your shadowform, or as a bonus action while it is active. You can submit yourself to the void for the shadowforms duration and grant the following benefits:
 - When you would normally roll one or more damage dice for a priest spell of 5th level or lower, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.
 - You can use your reaction when a creature that you can see targets you with an attack or spell, piercing its mind with the ramblings of the old gods. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC or be incapacitated until the start of your next turn.

At the end of each of your turns while Surrender to Madness is activate, you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 10 + 1 for each successful save), or take half your hit point maximum in psychic damage as the madness overwhelms you and ends your shadowform.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
