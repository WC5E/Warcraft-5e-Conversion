## Hunter
*The way of the hunter is one of mastery over the beasts of the world, an unparalleled precision in marksmanship, and the knowledge of how to survive in situations where others would perish.*

<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Ranger Sallina* &nbsp;</div>

Wild and barbaric looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a spear in his hands, he charges in with intense fury, a large bear running at his side, roaring as he engages, cutting down one enemy after another.

Tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, a night elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the blue dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.

Holding his hand high, a blood elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Thalassian, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.

### Inescapable Stalkers
From an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. As masters of their environment, hunters are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies. These expert marksman drop foes dead in their tracks with flawless shots from a bow, crossbow or rifle. With the ability to wield two weapons simultaneously, hunters can unleash a flurry of blows against anyone unfortunate enough to stumble into close combat with them.

The art of survival is central to the isolated life of a hunter. Hunters track beasts with ease and enhance their own abilities by attuning themselves to the feral aspects of various creatures. Hunters are known for the lifelong bonds they form with animals of the wild, training great hawks, cats, bears, and many other beasts to fight alongside them.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:404px;'></div>

### Proud Rangers
The hunter is a stalker in the wilds, living on his knowledge of survival and skill with a bow or rifle. He is deeply in tune with nature, and some of its mightiest beasts are his allies. 

Of Azeroth's many creatures, few can resist the hunter's call, and fewer can survive his fury. Hunters are as varied as the world's many climates, but they are universally renowned for their amazing abilities to find their prey and bring it down. Most hunters seek to aid the balance of nature along with their druidic allies. Elven rangers are not alone in their mastery of the wilderness. While an elven ranger prefers the bow, the hunter would rather get up close. A hunter is skilled in stealth, slipping through the woods like a ghost. 

### The Hunter's Choice
Hunter is the choice of life for those who reject societies that oppress the natural role of prey and predator, and also reject the druidic stance that we should observe rather than actively participants in the "Great Hunt". 

They follow a life of reverence for nature complimenting their tradition and willingness to use man-made tools. We are all tool-using creatures after all, and it is only natural to use that advantage afforded by nature to be better hunters. There are however also those hunters who prefer a more direct approach to tracking and hunting.

### Creating a Hunter
As you create your hunter character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the hunter's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship. or was your mentor slain, perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of hunters affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers?

### Hunter's Mark
*1st-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You are able to mark a target as your quarry. As a bonus action, choose a creature within 120 feet of you that you can see. The target is marked for 1 hour, until you use this feature again, or until it dies. The mark also ends if you fall unconscious. 

Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d4 damage to that creature when you hit it with a weapon attack. The amount of extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Hunter's Mark column of the Hunter table.

In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks you make to find your mark.

### Natural Explorer
*1st-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You are adept at navigating the natural world, and react with swift and decisive actions when attacked. You gain the following benefits:
 - You add your Wisdom modifier to your initiative rolls.
 - On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted.

In addition, you are skilled at traversing the wilderness, and gain the following benefits when you travel for an hour or more.

 - While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

### Fighting Style
*2nd-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Close Quarters Shooter 
When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

\columnbreak

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to use this benefit.

### Focus
*2nd-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your focus as a hunter sets you apart from simple trackers and scouts, giving you access to a pool of focus dice, which are d8s. Your hunter level deter&shy;mines the number of dice you have, as shown in the Focus Dice column of the Hunter table.

You can use these dice to gain a number of different benefits. You know three such benefits: Call of the Wilds, Precision Attack, and Survival Tactics. A focus die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended focus dice when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Call of the Wilds
When you make a check that allows you to apply your proficiency in Nature, Perception, or Survival, you can expend one focus die to bolster the check. Add half the number rolled on the focus die (rounded up) to your check. You apply this bonus after making the check, but before learning if it was successful.

#### Precision Attack
When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend a focus die to add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.

#### Survival Tactics
If you are hit by an attack while wearing light or medium armor, you can expend one focus die as a reaction and add the number rolled to your AC. If the attack still hits, you take half damage from it.

### Animal Empathy
*2nd-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

Your mastery of hunter lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and the land around you.

You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it not to attack.

You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 24 hours.

### Hunter Archetype
*3rd-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You choose to stake your path by the ideals of a hunter archetype: Beast Master, Marksmanship or Survival, each detailed at the end of the class description. 

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Tame Beast
*3rd-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You show a strengthened connection to the wilds and are able to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.

You may attempt to tame a beast within 60 feet of you that can see and hear you, the beast can be no larger than Medium with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower. Taming a beast requires the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food and is a process that often takes many hours of work, or days (DM's discretion).

Once you tame a beast, it gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can only have one beast tamed at your side at a time.

#### Companion's Bond
Your loyal companion gains a variety of benefits.

- The beast loses its Multiattack action, if it has one. 
- Your companion obeys your commands as best it can. <br> It shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn imme&shy;diately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you use your bonus action to command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast acts on its own.
- Your beast companion has abilities and statistics determined in part by your level. Using your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, your companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.
- Your beast gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient in all saving throws.
- For each character level you gain after 3rd, your beast companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.
- Whenever you gain an *Ability Score Improvement* class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
- Your companions alignment changes to sharing yours.

### Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

At this level and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

\columnbreak

### Fleet of Foot
*8th-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

In addition, you are able to pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them or taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or similar hazards.

### Predator's Knowledge
*10th-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can glean intimate knowledge about the capabilities of your marked target. You can use your action to learn two of the following characteristics of your choice about the target of your hunter's mark if it's within 120 feet. 
 - Creature Type
 - Armor Class
 - Speed
 - Damage Vulnerabilities
 - Damage Resistances
 - Damage Immunities
 - Senses

Once you have gleaned the capabilities of a creature, you cannot use Predator’s Knowledge to learn more about the creature, or another creature like it, for the next 24 hours.

### Stalker
*14th-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. In addition, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Honed Senses
*18th-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. 

You are also aware of the location of any invisible crea&shy;tures within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Aspect of the Wild
*20th-level Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You become an unparalleled hunter. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

## Hunter Archetypes
All hunters have certain things in common, such as their love for the wilderness, or their passion for beasts. But some hunters have more than love for beasts, and others a greater love for the wild, hunters fall into three categories: Beast Master, Marksman, and Survival.

### Beast Master
Among the gifted hunters, there are those who are drawn to the beasts of the wild and seek to bond with such crea&shy;tures. Beastmasters are often drawn towards the primal world, invigorated by its dangerous and untamed nature. The primitive world becomes their home and its ferocious predators becomes kin.

#### Dire Tamer
*3rd-level Beast Master Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You show a keen mind when dealing with beasts and are able to tame beasts that are Large or smaller with a challenge rating of 1 or lower.

#### Aspect of the Beast
*3rd-level Beast Master Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

You gain the ability to cast the *beast sense* spell, but only as a ritual and only on your beast companion.

#### Kill Command
*5th-level Beast Master Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>


You and your beast companion form a more potent fighting team. You can use your bonus action and expend a focus die to issue a kill command to your beast companion. The beast takes the Attack action, making all attacks with advantage. You add the focus die to the damage roll of the first attack that hits.

#### Evasive Maneuver
*7th-level Beast Master Hunter feature*<br/>
<div style='margin-top:-4px;'></div>

When you or your beast <br> companion are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to allow the both of you to avoid the brunt of the effect.

You take no damage if you succeed the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. Your beast companion must be able to hear you and you must be able to see it in order for it to benefit from your Evasive Maneuver feature.
