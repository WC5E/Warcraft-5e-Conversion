## Warrior
*Now, watch them attack me. Pitiful! Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come to challenge ME? I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come? No, these saurok will crumple before me like <br> paper before the flame!*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Skeer the Bloodseeker* <span style="margin-left:90px"></span></div>

A human in clanging plate armor holds her 
<br> shield high before her as she charges toward the 
<br> massed kobolds. A night elf behind her, clad in 
<br> studded leather armor, peppers the kobolds with 
<br> arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The dwarf nearby shouts orders, helping
the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.

An orc in chainmail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion in a swift action, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a blood elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.

A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight, and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning forth to smite him.

### Ancient Practice
For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Warriors combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. 

The warrior’s battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at hamstrings in a blur of steel. Every dragon slain, corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon banished from Azeroth has trembled in the face of these lords of war.

Warriors are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:670px;'></div>

### Well-Rounded Specialists
Warriors learn the basics of all combat styles. Every warrior can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a warrior is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on protection their allies from mortal blows, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some prefer a single large weapon able to be wielded with extraordinary force. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

### Creating a Warrior
As you build your warrior, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane fighters around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught -- unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms. Or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions -- the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.

## Martial Archetypes
Different warriors choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects your approach.

### Arms
Arms warriors are forged not in the classroom, tavern, or workshop, but in the dueling pits and on the arena floor. These warriors are patient fighters, waiting to capitalize on moments when their opponent is left exposed. Many arms warrior gravitate towards two-headed weapons, weapons that allow them to deliver devastating, overpowering blows, fully exploiting their enemies’ weaknesses.

#### Overpower
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to use your weapon as a barrier. When you are hit by a melee attack, you can use you reaction to roll 1d10 and add the total to your Armor Class. If your overpower causes the attack to miss you, you can make one weapon attack against the target as part of the same reaction.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Dauntless
At 3rd level, your rage is replenished even as you pour it into your attacks. You regain 1 rage at the end of your turn if you hit a creature with a rage move during it.

#### Commanding Shout
Starting at 7th level, you are able to command an ally to attack your quarry. As a bonus action, choose a friendly creature within 60 feet of you who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make <br> one melee weapon attack.

#### Colossus Smash
Upon reaching 11th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you may sunder their defenses and give the next weapon attack made against the target before the end of your next turn advantage. You may only use colossus smash once on each of your turns.

#### Deadly Calm
Starting at 15th level, you instinctively enter a defensive stance when things get rough. While you are below half <br> of your hit point maximum, you have advantage on any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw you make.

#### Opportunity Strikes
At 18th level, you respond to openings in enemies defense with unmatched ferocity. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature's turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can't use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.

\columnbreak

### Fury
Fury warriors are among the most feared of combatants, these fearless fighters venture into the fray with a lust for battle, disregarding their own defense to deliver punishing blows with brute force. Many fury warriors favor weapons capable of being wielded in one-hand to unleash a flurry of attacks carving their opponent to pieces.

#### Rampage
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to rampage. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

#### Fearful
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill if you don't already have it and when you make an ability check with it, you can choose to use your Strength modifier instead of your Charisma modifier for the check.

#### Single-Minded Fury
Starting at 7th level, your brutish strength allows you to wield weapons with might unmatched by other warriors. 

When you wield a weapon that deals a single damage die, the damage die of the weapon is increased by 1. For example, a shortsword that normally deals 1d6 damage instead deals 1d8 damage. A weapon's damage die can't <br> be increased beyond a 1d12.

#### Thirst for Blood
At 11th level, when a hostile creature within 20 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards the creature without provoking oppor&shy;tunity attacks. If this movement brings you within reach of the creature, you may make one weapon attack against the creature as part of the reaction.

#### Devastating Critical
Beginning at 15th level, when you score a critical hit with a weapon attack, you gain a bonus to that weapon’s damage roll equal to your level in this class.

#### Frothing Berserker
At 18th level, if you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points and doesn't kill you outright, you can use your reaction to delay falling unconscious and immediately take an extra turn. While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you. When the extra turn ends, you fall unconscious if you still have 0 hit points. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Protection
Protection warriors demonstrate a knack for the use of a shield, nullifying opponent’s advances and creating oppor&shy;tunities for counterattacks. For them, being the toughest soldier on the front means nothing if allies are left vulner&shy;able to the enemy's attack. These stalwart defenders are integral to the success of any military campaign. 

#### Taunt
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use your action to taunt creatures within 30 feet of you. Any creature of your choice
within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Rage save DC or have disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. 

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Anger Management
At 3rd level, your rage is renewed by blows made against you. When a hostile creature hits you with an attack, you immediately gain 1 rage point. You can only benefit from this effect once per turn.

#### Intercept
Beginning at 7th level, when a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to intercept the attack, forcing the attack to target you instead.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all spent uses after finishing a long rest.

#### Softened Blows
Beginning at 11th level, even the strongest of blows will not fault your defense. Any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit and you have advantage on any check or saving throw made to avoid being knocked prone.

#### Inspiring Presence
Starting at 15th level, you can extend the benefit of your Indomitable feature to an ally. When you use Indomitable to reroll an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw and you aren't incapacitated, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of you that also failed its save against the same effect. If that creature can see or hear you, it can reroll its saving throw and must use the new roll.

#### Never Surrender
At 18th level, whenever you start your turn below half of your hit point maximum, you gain 1d10 + your Constitution modifier temporary hit points. You don't gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.

## Rage Maneuvers
If a rage maneuver has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the maneuver at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

#### Berserker Rage
You can use your action and spend 3 rage points to end one effect that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

\columnbreak

#### Bloodthirst
When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 3 rage points to bolster yourself in the moment. When done, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Warrior level. These hit points lasts  for 1 minute.

#### Cleave
*Prerequisite: 6th level*
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 4 rage to attempt to cleave another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, roll damage for it as if it was a normal attack. 

#### Deep Wounds
*Prerequisite: 6th level*
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 2 rage points to attempt a deep wound. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose 1d4 hit points due to blood loss. The deep wound lasts for 1 minute.

At the end of its turn, the target loses another 1d4 hit points. It then makes another Constitution saving throw, ending the bleeding on a successful save.

#### Execute
*Prerequisite: 6th level*
<div style='margin-top:-6px;'></div>
