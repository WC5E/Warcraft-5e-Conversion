## Druid
*Standing in the way of nature is heresy. Even when nature's force is a destructive one.*
<div style="text-align:Right"> 

*— Malfurion Stormrage* &nbsp;</div>

Clutching an engraved staff stitched with leaves, a night elf summons the powers of elune, calling down raw blue energy of the moon upon a terrible foe, smashing upon its body and encasing it whole for a brief moment.

Crouching out of sight on a low hanging tree branch, in the form of a large feral tiger, a worgen scouts out from his hiding spot towards the constructions of Zul'Gurub, watch&shy;ing every move of the jungle trolls patrolling.

Holding near her sickle and staff, a young tauren druid <br> is making beautiful ritual, making tiny seeds sprinkle into <br> a perfect circle of faintly glowing green lights, healing an endured ally to the best of her capabilities.

Rushing forward towards his companion's aid, rumbling the ground as his body transforms into a giant bear crea&shy;ture with tusks, an experienced troll runs to his ally's aid, blocking a fatal blow with its fur.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:210px;'></div>

### Nature's Power
Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature’s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones. Druids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies. 

They are deeply in tune with the animal spirits of Azeroth. As master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, creatures of water, and creatures of air with ease. This flexibility allows them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. These keepers of the natural order are among the most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a moment’s notice.

### Protectors of Balance
Guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life, Druids have unmatched versatility on the field of battle. This is in part because druidism is much more than a fighting discipline. It’s a way of life steeped in tradi&shy;tions so ancient that even the origin of their kind is preser&shy;ved largely in mythology passed on through millennia.

Druids harness nature’s raw energy for an incredible breadth of offensive and defensive abilities, as well as to re&shy;store life to the wounded. Through communion with nature and the demigod Cenarius, Lord of the Forest, Druids are supernaturally endowed with the gift of shapeshifting, allowing them to take the form of all manner of nature’s creatures and access powers as distinct as they are diverse.

### Creating a Druid
As you are creating your druid character, consider the bond you have with the natural world around you. Perhaps you always found comfort in the beasts of the wilds and have spent long in the shape of an animal, imitating nature itself? Perhaps your home was ravaged by raiders and you looked to the forces of nature for aid in rebuilding what was lost, seeking to restore that which has been damaged? or perhaps you have been raised by the faithful of Elune and have embraced the goddess as your own. Maybe your character was born in the depths of the elven forests, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character's destiny.

Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove? Or perhaps you become an adventurer to find your bond to nature elsewhere in the world.

#### Quick Build
You can make a druid quickly be following these sugges&shy;tions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. (Some druids who focus more on their physical strength than mental makes Strength or Dexterity higher than Wisdom). Second, choose the hermit background.

#### Optional Rule: Multiclassing
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the *Player's Handbook*, here's what you need to know if you choose druid as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum.*** As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Wisdom score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a druid.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If druid isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a druid: light armor, nature skill.

***Spell Slots.*** Add your levels in the druid class (or half your levels if you choose the Path of Feral subclass) to the appropriate levels from other class to determine your available spell slots.

\columnbreak

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak, read and write Druidic, a language sacred to druids that is not taught to outsides without severe consequences for the teacher and teached.

### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 of the *Player's Handbook* for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the druid spell list.

#### Cantrips
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast a druid spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells. 

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attune-ment to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack with one.

<div style="text-align: Center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br> your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br> your Wisdom modifier
</div>

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Shapeshifting
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume a druidic shape. There is no limitation to how often you can shapeshift into a shape that you know.

\columnbreak

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your druid level determines the shapes you can transform into, as shown in the Shapeshifts table. At 2nd level, for example, you can shapeshift into a cat or bear, among other shapeshifts.

##### Shapeshifts
|&nbsp; Level |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Available Shapeshifts |
|:-----------:|:-|:--------------------------------|
|&nbsp; 2nd   || Cat, Bear, Moonkin, Treant        |
|&nbsp; 4th   || Aquatic, Travel                   |
|&nbsp; 8th   || Flight                            |

There is no limit to how long you can stay shapeshifted, reverting to your normal form as a bonus action. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your retain your game statistics, alignment, and person-ality. While shapeshifted you are considered unarmored and calculate your Armor Class according to the shape.
- When you shapeshift your hit points does not change, and any damage taken whilst in a shape carries over to your normal form.
- You can't cast spells, unless the shape says otherwise, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabil&shy;ities of your shapeshift. However, transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as *moonbeam*, that you've already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the shapeshift is physically capable of doing so, in addition to gaining those of the shape. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new shape also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment merged with your form has no effect and cannot be activated until you leave the form, but any passive magical properties will still affect you.

### Druid Paths
At 2nd level, you choose a druidic path: Balance, Feral, or Restoration, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 20th level.

### Wild Affinities
Having accustomed yourself with the druidic forces, you have learnt how to harness the true potential of its powers and the potential of certain shapes.

At 3rd level, you gain two wild affinities of your choice. Your affinity options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain druid levels, you gain additional affinities of your choice, as shown in the Affinities Known column of the Druid table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the affinities you know and replace it with another affinities that you could learn at that level.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | CLASSES</div>

\pagebreakNum

> ##### Druidic Forms
> Shapeshifts are an extension of the druid. Both as a person but also as a race, a taurens shapeshifts might have horns similar to their own, an orc or troll might grant theirs tusks, a night elf might decorate theirs with signs of Elune, and so on. Similarly their beasts might be different, a night elf might choose a slim panther while a tauren chooses a stout lion.
>
> Certain shapes does not have to be grand transfor&shy;mations, a druid who shapeshifts into a moonkin might not become a giant owlbeast but instead take on qualities of Elune, make their eyes flare bright with silver and cover their skin in the dots of a starry night. A druid who takes the shape of a treant might instead take on qualities of the wilds. Turn their skin to bark, their hair to leaves, and so on.
>
> The shapeshifts are yours to personalize, although each is tied to certain type of animal or creature, you can modify its appearance to better fit your race, or talk with your DM about making it something completely different.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Timeless Body
Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield has caused you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

### Soul of the Forest
Beginning at 18th level, your connection with nature grows to new lengths, deepening your bond with nature and enabling you to conjure a gateway into the Emerald Dream.

Spending 10 minutes in an area of unspoiled nature, you can conjure a gateway to the Emerald Dream, the entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when conjuring the gateway can enter into the Emerald Dream for as long as the gate-way remains open. You can open and close the gateway if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the gateway on Azeroth crumbles and is effectively invisible. The gateway remains conjured for 24 hours, at which point it crumbles entire and cannot be conjured again for 7 days.

Additionally, beasts and plants of the wilds can sense your connection to nature, giving you advantage on all skill and ability checks made to communicate with them.

## <span style="margin-left:25px"></span> Druid Paths
<span style="margin-left:25px"></span> Although all druids have a deep love for nature and 
<span style="margin-left:30px"></span> wilderness, some carry a deep love for the beasts of 
<span style="margin-left:35px"></span> the world and imitate their shapes. Some have a 
<span style="margin-left:40px"></span> deep love for the goddess Elune and others wish to 
<span style="margin-left:45px"></span> preserving life. All druids can be placed into one of 
<span style="margin-left:50px"></span> following paths: Balance, Feral, or Restoration.

\columnbreak

### Path of Balance
Druids on the Path of Balance become fierce combatants capable of calling upon the forces of nature and the beloved goddess Elune to guide their hand. Many of these druids have a deep connection with the natural world and work to protect it from the many outside threats.


##### Path of Balance Spells
|&nbsp; Druid Level |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Spells           |
|:---------:|:-|:-----------------------------------|
|&nbsp; 3rd || enhance ability, moonbeam            |
|&nbsp; 5th || daylight, ✦ starsurge                  |
|&nbsp; 7th || confusion, grasping vine             |
|&nbsp; 9th || commune with nature, wrath of nature |
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

*✦ New spells can be found in chapter 6 later in this book* 

#### Path Spells
Your mystical connection to Elune infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to path spells.

Once you gain access to a path spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

#### Innervate
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with the nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can re-cover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.

#### Force of Nature
Beginning at 6th level, you can tap into the forces around you and use them to bolster your spellwork.

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature, you can choose to deal extra damage to it equal to your druid level, or restore hit points to it equal to your druid level. You can choose to use this feature before or after an attack roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Astral Influence,
Upon reaching 10th level, you find solace and empower&shy;ment in the goddess Elune, you gain the following features.

- You gain resistance to radiant damage.
- You can choose to deal radiant damage with your Force of Nature feature, rather than the spell's damage type.
- You have advantage on checks and saving throws to avoid being charmed or frightened by spell effects.
