### Aranasi
Hideous eight-legged demons called the Aranasi have been sighted among the ranks of the Burning Legion, acting variously as fodder, soldiers and commanders.
Their life cycle is rapid, hatched from eggs as spider-like creatures before rapidly growing into intelligent arachnoid monsters. They have a mastery over their natural venom, which can be frighteningly deadly, and as they invade territories they are seen transforming whole regions into breeding pits of festering pools and skittering death.

***Spider Queens.*** As female aranasi mature, they undergo a transformation. Becoming significantly more intelligent, they stand up on two of their many legs, with the others splayed behind them like wings, and typically take the role of commanders among the Legion, gaining lofty royal titles and choosing consorts.

***The Silk Road.*** Aranasi broodmothers command dangerous and tricky magic, moulding captured territories into their own silken palaces via their race's webbing. Stepping into such a parlour can be extraordinarily dangerous, as any and all nearby aranasi, from the old to the newly-hatched, will come to the aid of their queen.

### Doomguards

*"I remember well the sting of defeat at the conclusion of the Third War. I have waited far too long for my revenge. Now the shadow of the Legion falls over this world. It is only a matter of time until all of your failed creation... is undone." - Supreme Lord Kazzak*

The fearsome ered'ruin race are among the most recognisable, and most feared, of the Burning Legion's infinite army. These hulking, great masses of muscle match perfectly the image of demons across all worlds; piercing horns, enormous wings, hooves, great flaming swords, and an unstoppable desire for murder and destruction. Believed to be among the earliest of the Legion's forces, doomguards have a deadly mastery over destructive magic and raw martial strength, and their sheer love of chaos makes them the ideal demonic warriors. Often individual doomguards act as lieutenants under greater demons, or command lesser troops on the battlefield. An army of many doomguards is a force unto itself, and many of the Legion's greatest victories have been at the hands of these fearsome creatures.
Their immense strength and violent nature makes them unstoppable in combat, and their brutish appearance hides an insidious intelligence tempered by the fires of eternal war.

***Doom Bringers.*** During times of Legion attack, the doomguards are usually the most immediately visible threat, seldom seen outside out outright invasion. However, it is often said that if the invasion has gone so far that these demons are seen in battle, then it is already too late, and doom has been assured.

***Demonic Overlords.*** Some of these fearsome demons ascend to even greater degrees of raw strength and power, becoming respected commanders and generals in command of enormous armies of demons. Doomlords such as these have left scars across entire worlds, and even in defeat they have been known as exceptionally persistent.

***Terrible Fiends.*** Some demons, similar in appearance and power to the ered'ruin, have been sighted among Legion forces. These terrorguards have a similar profile, but their appearance is somehow more monstrous, with crowns of many horns circling their heads, and flame-belching, toothy maws in place of their torsos, accompanied by ever-staring eyes. Their relationship to the doomguards is unknown, but they well-earn their name, as they beget terror wherever they go.

> ##### Variant: Terrorguard
> Some doomguards have a gigantic mouth in their stomach, which can belch flames. They gain the following attack.
>
> ***Belching Gutmouth.*** The doomguard belches fire from the giant mouth in its stomach. All creatures in a 20-foot cone must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

### Felbat
On some demon-infested world long ago, a species of bat-like creatures was mutated beyond recognition into the disgusting felbats, which now act as a combination of mounts, spies and aerial assault for the Burning Legion. Their massive bodies are surprisingly agile in the air, where they can safely stay out of harm's way while they assault the ground with corruptive globs of mucus. The horrendous, high-pitched screams of a swarm of felbats has caused many defenders against the Legion running for their lives.

### Felhound

The bloodhounds of the Legion, though their resemblance to canines is superficial. If their scaly bodies, eyeless faces, long and toothy maws, hoofed feet and strange, almost flower-like tentacular feelers extending from their shoulders can be ignored, then their behaviour can be called canine - their intense desire to chase and hunt down their targets, and an inbuilt obedience to domineering masters. Felhounds of all kinds are blind, and see through an innate ability to sense magic, for which they hunger constantly. When commanded, they will weaken their spellcasting prey by devouring the very magic used against them, and then will use their splayed tentacles to drain the mana and life of whatever creature is unfortunate enough to cross them.


> ##### Variant: Felstalker

The felstalker that inflicted this disease on the target regains hit points equal to half the necrotic damage. A target can only be inflicted with Fel Disease from one source. The target can repeat its saving throw at the end of each round to end the effect, or the affliction can be removed by any effect which cures diseases or dispels magic.

>### Actions
>***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage + 7(2d6) fire damage.

### Felsteed

Even warlocks have the need for steeds, and no mere horse would be fitting for masters of such power. For this reason the felsteed was created from the native creatures of Azeroth, warped and corrupted into obedient minions like the others. No longer able to be called a horse, the felsteed is a warped demonic creature with flame in its blood, and hate and pain in its eyes. 

***Dreadsteeds of Xoroth.*** The felsteed is but a shallow copy of the true steed of demonic masters; the dreadsteed from the Legion world, Xoroth. Flaming hooves, curved horns and fiery breath crown the demon horse, not merely corrupted from nature but born purely of the Fel. A significantly more difficult and complicated ritual is required by warlocks to even see one of these horses.

\pagebreak

### Imp
*"Ohhh, sure! Send the little guy!"*

The fodder of the Legion, the lowest in the hierarchy. Weak, expendable, too numerous to count, and able to be spawned on an almost industrial scale, fiery imps make up an appreciable portion of the Legion's invasion tactics, often being deployed in swarms at areas and allowed to go hog wild. Imps have an innate, gleeful love for destruction, and when uncontrolled will happily use their fire magic to burn anything around them with zero hesitation. Their tiny, pathetic bodies contain an unbearable amount of pure energetic enthusiasm, and their love for burning is perhaps only matched for their love of talking, which makes them extremely unpopular among the other rank and file of the Legion. It is a favourite pastime of any demon commander to order a squad of imps to charge to their deaths, knowing that whether or not they destroy anything, the universe will benefit from fewer imps.

***Devilish Familiars.*** Imps are an extremely common sight among warlocks, even outside of the Legion's command, as they are easy to summon and control, are obedient, and easy to replace. As such they are often used as assistants or familiars by summoners with a need for an extra pair of hands, but little concern with what happens to them.

***Speculative Origins.*** Legend among imps is that they came from a world full of creatures like themselves who had a fondness for mischief and fun, but which spawned as spirits of nature. The truth of it is unknown, and demon lords will forbid any talk of such things, but it is nevertheless a comforting thought for imps everywhere, that they may have once come from somewhere.

***Fel Imps.*** Some imps are far larger than others, and burn with brighter flames of sickly green Fel. Whether this is a natural development or a mutation caused by experimentation by uncaring masters is unknown, but these rare Fel imps are seldom a welcome sight, as their fiery magic can be far more powerful.

### Infernal
*"We never paid any heed to the ancient prophecies. Like fools we clung to the old hatreds, and fought as we had for generations. Until the day the sky rained fire... and a new enemy came among us. We stand now, upon the brink of destruction... for the Reign of Chaos has come at last."*

A cloudy sky, casting shadow over a battlefield. An army of demons swarms, held back bravely by the world's defenders. Suddenly, an assault that no warrior can hold back - breaching through the cloud cover far above, streaking from the sky with a burning, flaming trail of sick green fire, falls a meteor. It slams into the earth, shattering bones and burning skin and armour away with its impact. The defending soldiers, wounded but not yet broken, watch in horror as the burning boulder cracks, moves, and unfolds. Crags become shoulders, arms and legs. Flames give it a vaguely humanoid shape, capped by hideous green eyes in a skull-like face. An infernal has landed among them, a construct of pure destruction, and its sole purpose is to break them.

***Infernal Constructs.*** Ever-burning, the Legion's infernals are crafted on their own worlds out of flaming cores and black rock. They are thoughtless, having no desires or needs, and follow only one instruction - destroy. They are among the Legion's most deadly and feared weapons, and their summoning invariably precedes doom and terror.

***Blazing Invasion.*** Infernals are sometimes deployed en masse by summoners, and predictably, the arrival of hundreds of blazing meteors alone can cause untold damage. As they awaken, the infernals will often do the job of breaking a siege, tearing defenses open and burning away any opposition.

***Immolation and Destruction.*** Little can harm their rocky form, and their Fel cores break magic cast upon them. Their constantly burning bodies set alight anyone foolish enough to go close, and their sheer strength will smash any survivors.

### Mo'arg
*“Anger... Hate... These are tools I can use.” - The Maker*

A deadly combination of brains and brawn, the mo'arg are a varsatile race of demons that have fulfilled several roles in the Burning Legion across history. The vast, vast majority act as Felguard foot soldiers, unrecognisable from their non-conscripted kin. Others are born stunted and weak. Those few remaining take on positions befitting their strength and intelligence, often ending up as commanders or high-ranking engineers. Aside from the felguard army, mo'arg are seldom content to appear generic, often modifying themselves or setting out specifically to gather scars and unique weaponry, and in general the higher-functioning mo'arg tend to be much more individualistic than other demons.

***Stunted Brethren.*** There are a subset of diminutive, sickly mo'arg which lack the brainpower or muscle to serve the Legion in the same ways as their kin. These stunted mo'arg, called gan'arg, act instead as assistant engineers and technicians on Legion-run worlds, seldom seeing combat. They are treated poorly and are given no reason to have ambition, and as such their lives are brief and utilitarian.

***Mechanical Marvels.*** Some mo'arg prefer intellectual endeavours, and act as some of the best engineers of the Legion's war machine. These mo'arg see fit to sever parts of their own bodies and replace them with mechanical upgrades, no two alike; common replacements include grabbing arms, cutting blades, or dangerous weaponry.

***Brutish Strength.*** Other mo'arg prefer to employ their natural hulking strength in the Legion's endless conquest, wielding massive swords, clubs or axes, donning thick armour and simply wading through  their foes' defences. These brutes do not lack intellect, but their preference for stomping, smashing and breaking suits their colossal bodies perfectly.

#### Felguard
Numbered in the millions, the felguard comprise the shock troops of the Burning Legion, deployed to innumerable degrees to overwhelm their foes with a combination of martial discipline and sheer numbers. Uncomplicated, these demons are bred solely for combat, and are expected to live and die for pure war. They do so with gusto, charging their foes, isolating them and using their immense strength to obliterate them. And should a felguard fall in battle - no matter. Where one falls, another shall take its place. And another... and another...

### Dread Lord
*“I'm always on the winning side.” - Varimathras*

The dreaded infiltrators of the demon army, and arguably the most valuable and respected species among the Burning Legion, the Nathrezim race are perhaps second only to the Eredar themselves in the eyes of their dark master. It is hard to overstate the impact that the Dreadlords have had on the entire Great Dark, as their insidious efforts have led them to have a hand in almost every major event since before the Burning Legion was even created.
Pale skin, dark eyes, and vicious fangs mark the faces of evil. They are vampiric demons with a natural skill for manipulation, cruelty and espionage, far more likely to use their powers to turn others to evil than to do something as crass and direct as combat - though their prowess in combat is legendary. Acting as high commanders and infiltrators for the Legion, many are seen ordering grand armies into new and confusing positions using information about their foes that they themselves have gathered. Their ability to change their shape and addle or even control the minds of mortals has led to intense distrust and confusion among their enemies, which suits the dreadlords perfectly.

***Vampiric Desires.*** The nathrezim are well known for their thirst for blood, hungering constantly for the vital fluid. this hunger fuels them in combat, and they will drain the lives of their victims until there is nothing left. Even their minions, children of the night such as insects or bats, will thirst for blood, never to be satisfied.

***Master Infiltrators.*** It is said that, at any time, in any place, someone you know may be a dreadlord in disguise. Their sheer skill for gathering information, manipulation and espionage is their greatest strength, and has led the Legion to countless victories. There are no lines they will not cross to further their master's goals, stealing knowledge and power from every world and every realm, even the land of the dead. Some dreadlord spies have gone years, or decades, unmasked.

***Makers of Villains.*** Ironically, their greatest impact on history may be their ability to influence the creation of even greater threats, and not always on purpose. They have had a hand in the creation of some of Azeroth's greatest threats, making ripples and waves far beyond the scope of comprehension. In hushed tones, it is said that they even had a hand in the corruption of the Dark Titan Sargeras - though none would dare claim this as fact.

The target isn't under the dread lord's control, but it takes the dread lord's requests and action in the most favorable way.

### Pit Lord
*"Yes... yes! I can feel his burning eyes upon me, he is close...so close. And then your world will be unmade, your lives as nothing!" - Mannoroth the Destructor*

The annihilan are perhaps the most fearsome, dangerous and destructive of all of the demonic races. Known as Pit Lords, these colossal creatures act as high commanders of the Legion's invasion forces, and are rarely content to command anywhere other than in the field of battle.
Built like mountains, their reptilian tails and four cawed legs give rise to immensely powerful upper bodies, protected by armour as thick as doors. Their barrel-like arms typically wield swords or polearms the length of buildings, capable of shattering the ground beneath them. Their gigantic wings are worthless for flight, as they are simply too heavy, but are like a shield of steel, while their backs, from head to tail, are lit by a blazing mane of emerald flames. Their faces, tusked and filled with nests of tiny razor-sharp teeth, spew flame with every breath.
Pit lords use little magic or cunning, preferring instead to end battles decisively using their brute strength and fearsome tactics to overcome an enemy. Their command over their inferiors is unquestioned, and failure is punished by death. They respect nothing but strength, and seek nothing but total destruction.

***Unrelenting Power.*** Pit lords do not give up. Ever. Unless it is completely killed, nothing will stop its slaughter. There have been pit lords with their hands removed, who have simply replaced them with weapons. Pit lords imprisoned will literally never stop raging and heaving at their bonds. Refusal to obey them will result in extreme rage, while those given orders will put the entire being into reaching their goal, no cost too small.

***Legacy of Death.*** Even death does not stop a pit lord's malice. Their bodies are loaded with overwhelming power, and upon their death all of it is unleashed at once in a catastrophic explosion. Even afterwards, their blood has a hideous corruptive potency that will never go away; drinking the blood of a pit lord is enough to permanently transform a creature unregognisably, while the blood is also able to deeply corrupt the land around it until it too is unrecognisable. This blood has been seen raising the dead, and even congealing into living globules. The death of a pit lord is n ongoing catastrophe that may take decades to be cleared.

***Bloody Enslavement.*** The blood of a pit lord's most famous property is also its worst; when consumed, a creature will be bound to the demon. Enslaved, unable to resist its will, and overwhelmed with bloodlust, creatures so enslaved will be under command until the moment of the demon's death. This was first seen when the demon Mannoroth's blood was consumed by the orcish race, turning their brown skin green.

### Shivarra
*"Business... or pleasure?"  - Mother Shahraz*

Exotic, many-armed women approaching a young, enterprising adventurer may not necessarily be unwelcome, but a shivarra will have no intention beyond warping a foe into a loyal servant of Sargeras, and failing that, cutting them to pieces with countless bladed weapons. Equally deadly and beautiful, he shivarra comprise some of the Legion's most devout and loyal followers, who follow the Legion's goals with an almost religious zeal. To them nothing is more offensive than slights against their master or his Burning Crusade, and subsequently the shivarra often take on a supporting role in the demon army's ranks as charismatic leaders, performing an almost motherly role by ensuring that the demons believe the right beliefs, and ensuring that failure to do so is punished horribly.

### Succubi
Succubi are some of the best-known demons even outside of the circles of demons and warlocks, and the reasons should be obvious; taking the form of an exceptionally attractive woman with relatively minimal demonic features, a succubus will act as the eyes and ears of the Burning Legion, working variously as anything from an infiltrator to a torturer. The name of their game is information, and using their powers of transformation and beguilement, succubi will infiltrate, commiserate and exterminate. It takes a strong will to overcome the wiles of a succubus, and many a warlock - often young men - will try to summon a succubus expecting submissive fealty, and will find themselves flayed and broken, while the demon quietly leaves with any useful knowledge she can find.

***Enchanting Beauty.*** Famously, a succubus has immense powers of seduction. Even without magic, these demons are charming, and combined with their shape changing, illusions and mind-altering powers, it is rare that their needs are unmatched.

***Hideous Torture.*** Without ever missing a beat, a succubus can go from seductive charm to cruel violence. Utilising a barbed whip, poison or shadowy magic, a succubus has a trained and intimate knowledge of how to cause as much pain as she possibly can.

If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's Charm for the next 24 hours

### Ur'zul
Wandering the broken streets and canyons of Argus, the Legion homeworld, one might see perhaps their most hideous and disturbing creation - the ur'zul. Disgusting amalgamations of flesh and souls, originally crafted from the countless millions of eredar souls claimed during the planet's original corruption by the Legion, ur'zul take the form of hound-like monsters with countless faces locked in expressions of horrifying, ceaseless agony, positioned above a nightmarish toothy mouth.  Ur'zul have none of the sympathy or love that these souls once felt; the creatures exist only to spread their suffering.

The visage appears, feels, and sounds exactly like the creature it impersonates, though it smells faintly of sulfur. Each visage is tethered to the Ur'zul by a stand of sickly white flesh that can extend up to 120 feet from the ur'zul. While the ur'zul has a visage extruded, it can see through its senses. The ur'zul can have up to three visages extruded from its body. The sickly tendrils are immune to damage, but servered if there is no opening at least 1 inch wide between the visage and the ur'zul.

### Vilefiends
Smart and aggressive, vilefiends are animalistic demons known to roam freely in groups, actively hunting mortals. Spiny and protected by a natural armour, their long limbs and rows of teeth are only their secondary weapons; first and foremost they are corrosive, spewing their acidic blood and bile at their prey in the hopes of dissolving them into sludge. Their bite can be crippling, and can corrode away even the toughest of metal. When damaged enough their blood vessels will burst, with high-pressure acid blood spewing generously.
