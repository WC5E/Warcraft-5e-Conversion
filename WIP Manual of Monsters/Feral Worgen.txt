> ##### Player Characters as Feral Worgens
> A humanoid bit by a worgen must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed. The curse has no effect on undead beings, such as the forsaken. A character bit begins to show the effects of the curse after 1d4 days, at which point the character is transformed into a feral worgen. It gains a Strength of 15 if their score isn't already higher, and their alignment changes to Chaotic Evil.
>
> The cursed character also gains the following indefinite madness, *"I hunger for the taste of blood and will kill anyone to taste it once more."*
>
> The character remains a feral worgen until a *greater restoration* spell or more powerful magic rids the character of their indefinite madness, at which point alignment returns to what it was before being bit, and the character gains the *Two Forms* feature and the *Worgen Form Traits* of the worgen race.
