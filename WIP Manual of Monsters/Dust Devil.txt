On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) bludgeo­ning damage and is flung up to 20 feet directly away from the elemental and knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the target only takes half damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.

Each creature other than the elemental within 5 feet of the upheaval must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the elemental's next turn. The elemental needs loose earth, rock, or something similar to use upheaval.
