Nothing is left to waste in the Scourge. A creation from the dark Scholomance, the bone golems are pieced together from remnants of skeletons too misshapen to use elsewhere, grafted with a pair of immense metal scythes. They are built solely to kill, and are deployed sparingly by their masters, perhaps owing to their unreliability, or tendency to rust.

Among the most distressing and intimidating of the Lich Kingâ€™s minions is the gigantic bone wraith, a skeletal guard of immense size and haunting appearance. Looking almost angelic with wings of bone, it is crafted from the much-suffering remnants of many bodies, all pushed together into a shape not remotely humanoid. They drift legless above the ground, with four skulls at the centre of a torso, and freakish arms wielding an axe made of yet more bone. The souls of these dead have been amalgamated together into something far lesser than the sum of its parts, able only to proclaim loyal battlecries in the name of its master.

**Bone Storm!** The signature strength of these creatures is their ability to spin their many-limbed bodies at extreme, rapid speed, flailing their spiny wing-like protrusions out alongside their bony weapon. A guttural call will invariably accompany this assault, placing the bone storm into a legend among those who survive it.

The bone wraith can have maximum two creatures grappled this way.

As the ruler of the damned, the Lich King naturally needed an elite caste of knights. These undead knights are granted immense power over death magic, cruel rune-inscribed blades that drain the lives of their foes, and command over appreciable portions of the Scourgeâ€™s armies. Intelligent and retaining their living personalities, albeit warped and broken into servitude, Death Knights became the feared top level of the Lich Kingâ€™s armies, elites that acted as royal guard to the Lich King.

**Wartime Progenitors.** The creation of orcish Death Knights by the original Horde preceded the undead champions of the Scourge, but there is little relation. The Lich King took a particular effort to take the concept and work it further, changing them from a mismatching of orcish spirit to human corpse, into a powerful new brand of undead far greater than any before it.

**Faded Light.** The second generation of Death Knights were created during the fall of Lordaeron at the hands of the first in their ranks, Prince Arthas Menethil. Following him, others were raised from the corpses of previously pious and loyal paladins, their powers warped and reversed  - healing became harm, protection became degradation, and resurrection became the raising of loyal undead. Wielding cursed runeblades and riding the skeletal remains of their loyal steeds, these knights marked the new age of the modern Scourge.

**Fallen Heroes.** The third generation, spawned exclusively to destroy champions of the Light, were far more industrial; hordes of corpses were raised, placed in identical armour, and put through intense trials. Relatively few survived, and those left became a new army of lesser elites, less powerful but more reliable than the previous generation - at least, until thousands of them broke free from their masterâ€™s command, and swore to destroy him.

> ***Hysteria.*** When an undead creature the deathknight can see makes an attack roll, the death knight can utter maddening words to it. The creature takes 7 (2d6) psychic damage and has advantage on all attack rolls it makes until the end of its turn.

A mysterious rank of ghostly warriors, spawned from the corpses of those insolent few who managed to draw the particular ire of the Scourgeâ€™s dark masters. These densely armoured wraiths revive feeling only regret and horror at what they have become, and are commanded to express these regrets through might and magic, standing as commanders of lesser undead. Their curse lends them no rest, and not even the comfort of sunlight may reach them.

A true Scourge invasion is headed by the iconic sight of a knight sat atop a skeletal horse, decked in armour and finery, mutated through dark magic to sport vicious horns and cruel, eyeless sockets. Expected to be as dangerous as they are unfalteringly obedient, these dread horses are an eternal symbol of the Scourgeâ€™s military might.

In the icy land of Northrend, undeath is the fate for all who fall under the gaze of the Lich King. No creature best demonstrates the Lich Kingâ€™s dominion over the land than his transformation of the godsâ€™ own creations, the giants. These honourable creatures have been broken down into their base parts, which are matched up and then re-attached to construct a parody of a giant, an abomination on a massive scale. Their blood replaced with ichor, their guts filled with the plague of undeath, and their very spinal fluid transforming into a vicious acid, these giants have been unmade as a symbol of the Lich Kingâ€™s total disregard for the ancient powers that have ruled Northrend for aeons.

The creature has to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion and become cursed. While cursed the creature cannot reduce its exhaustion level. Undead and constructs are immune to the curse.

Robbed of their bodies and their free will, but not their wit, a laughing doomskull is often what remains of necromancers who served the Scourge in life, but demonstrated no reason to be overly-rewarded upon their ascension into undeath. Perhaps transformed into mere skulls as punishment for hubris, or for insolence before their masters, doomskulls are nevertheless permitted to retain their significant magical power. Still intelligent and free-speaking, doomskulls miss no opportunity to make their displeasure heard, and though they lack any form of ambulation, they nevertheless endeavour to fill in as much space as they can through sheer force of personality.

The abandoned corpses of punished criminals are a particularly replenishable source of corpses for the Scourgeâ€™s necromancers, who are always in need of new supply. The hooded corpses of hanged thieves in particular are flooded with such regret and vitriol that they are most easily raised as geists. Still tied to their nooses and gazing through their hoods with single, mutated eyes, geists scramble on all fours like animals, speaking an incomprehensible mumbling language and often travelling in groups. Their frail bodies hide surprising strength, able to leap great distances and claw at their targets in ambush.

Following on from the very earliest known necromancers, necrolytes represent the low-tier clergy of the Cult of the Damned, or put another way, are the average working manâ€™s necromancer. In any cloister of the Scourgeâ€™s armies, there must be many hands constantly shifting and raising the corpses of the dead, and taking on this vital, albeit menial, task are the necrolytes. Practitioners of the religions that have grown out of the Scourge, they decry the Light, the elements, the ancestors or whatever other beliefs they may have previously held, instead making sermons on their new lord, the Lich King, and his greater servants.

Greater necromancers occupying a far higher rank in their cults, grand necrolytes act as spiritual leaders among the still-livin worshippers of the Scourgeâ€™s decree. They experience no doubts and have no questions about their chosen path, showing a piety that might make a paladin blush. Granted powers over life and death that dwarf those of other necromancers, these dark clerics often lead or perform the most skilful of rituals to create the more powerful creatures.
