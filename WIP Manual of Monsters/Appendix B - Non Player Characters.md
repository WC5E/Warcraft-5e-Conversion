# Nonplayer Characters

This is a partial release from the *Warcraft 5E* project's *Manual of Monsters*; a small group of friends having fun writing and sharing *Warcraft* material for D&D 5th Edition. 

We're mainly a group of friends looking to have fun with this, as our little hobby project with big ambitions. It is entirely out of our own time, and entirely for free. 

If you want to see more, follow the links at the bottom of this page. 

##### About these statblocks

This document contains statistics for different humanoid nonplayer characters (NPCs) that might be encountered during an adventure. 

Many of these statblocks are taken from the Dungeons & Dragons SRD 5.1, following guidelines on copying and modifying SRD content. From there, we've rewritten them with new features, new spell lists, and new text to better work for us as Warcraft NPCs. 

We also have a lot of more stand-out unique statblocks both made and otherwise planned, here we just wanted to have a lot of more typical NPCs flavoured for the setting. Check out the project link above for that.

At some point, we'd like to have an overview of what could be added to an NPC to reflect different races (the statblocks are all written for medium-sized humanoids), but that is a priority some way down the line for now.

The talented few that put the work into magical mastery may be recognized as an **archmage**, standing at the pinnacle of their power -- garnering great influence, as well as a few tricks of their own, along the way. Though often gruff and aloof, these prestigious spellcasters are powerful enough to turn the tide of battles that put the fate of the world at stake.

An **assassin** is a hired killer for those who desire skill, grace, and no evidence left behind. No mere rogue or cut-throat, an assassin has class, distinction, and at least five methods of killing any one person.

Across Azeroth, some find themselves eking out a life as a criminal; preying upon the communities around them. Whether will or chance brought a person to become a **bandit**, it is often a game of chance for whether these bands of thieves and pillagers rise to legend -- or fall to adventurers chasing a bounty placed upon them.

Always searching for a chance to use their freshly sharp&shy;ened blade, a **banit captain** is the leader of a community of cunning cutthroats. It is not unlike such a leader to turn to ruthless tactics to keep their band in check, or risk their own purse cut -- along with their throat.

**Bersekers** are terrifying warriors who head no warning when they rush forth into battle, lost in the haze of violence so pure as to drown out any pain they might feel. Simply powering through until all around them lay dead. They are particularly common among trolls and dwarves, though not unique to them.

Be they orcish peons or human peasants, merchants at the stalls or old women heading for the town well, every culture across Azeroth features some form of **commoner** among them -- the everyday folk tending to their own lives.

Blessed by the Light to bring forth justice, **crusaders** are the brave and bold; the valiant holy warriors who stand forefront in the battle against darkness. They are often recognized by their brilliant librams, and for the zeal by which they keep to their cause. This zeal has driven some to fanaticism, such as the case of the Scarlet Crusade.

> ***Demon Wings.*** When the demon hunter falls, it can sprout a pair of leathery wings from its back making it land on its feet and taking no damage from the fall.

Following Illidan Stormrage to battle the Burning Legion, a determined few have sacrificed everything to harness the powers of demonkind and become **demon hunters**.

They hold a burning determination in their work against demons and stand ever on guard for demonic corruption, even among their own ranks.

Through a connection to the Emerald Dream, **druids** druids are guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life. They have an immense versatility on the field of battle, harnessing a wide breadth of abilities through the forms of different beasts. 

Druids often band together in smaller groups or larger clans, that focus their teachings in around a particular animal totem and aspect of their powers, though 
<br /> it is not unusual for them to embrace multiple 
<br /> totems regardless of their clan. 

As examples, the Druids of the Claw keep 
<br /> cat and bear totems; the Druids of the Talon
<br /> keep bird totems; and the Druids of the Moon
<br /> keep totems of the great owlbear.

For a **gladiator**, Azeroth is host to a multitude of bloody arenas in which they may risk it all for coin and fame -- sometimes even for freedom, though seldom for honor. 

The bombastic nature of these gladiatorial displays owe back to the traditions of the ogre lords of Draenor, to whom the sport is a long-standing cultural tentpole.

> ##### Variant: Net-Throwing Gladiator
> Throwing nets are a common tool for seasoned gladiators. A gladiator fighting this way gains the following traits in place of its Shield Bash action:
>
> <br /> ***Net Thrower.*** The gladiator can throw a net in place of any melee or ranged attack it makes. It can only throw one net per turn.
> 
> <br /> ***Reinforced Net.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit*: The target is restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free itself or another creature within reach on a success. Dealing 20 slashing damage to the net (AC 15) frees the target without harming it and destroys the net.
>
> The gladiator carries 2 (1d4+1) nets.

Among elves,  **rangers** are some of the most respected figures one can find, and any non-elf following the same path will often be treated to much of the same reverence. It is their charge to learn the lay of the land and guard it with utmost care.

<!-- TODO: When this is in the book, it needs to have page numbers -->

> ##### Variant: Beast Companions
> Rangers are often accompanied by beasts of the wild as partners in battle, which are added to an encoun&shy;ter as standalone creatures. This is usually a creature of CR 1 or below. Here are some examples of such tamed beasts (pages will be added later).

As swift as they are agile, **scouts** excel as guides through the wilds, as well as reconnaissance workers and expedient messengers. Those embroiled in military service will keep themselves leaps ahead of their fellows, ever on guard for any encroaching threat.

Whether they are grunts, sentinels, or **soldiers**, the back&shy;bone of any army is its standing ranks. In some cultures, the common folk may find themselves drafted out of sheer necessity, while in other cultures it can be considered a matter of pride to partake.

In the hunt for vital information, employing a **spy** is always a sure-fire approach -- and in a world led by war, they can be rather commonplace. Two organizations particularly well known for the art are the *Shattered Hand* for the Horde and the *SI:7* for the Alliance.

Tribal societies can be found far and wide across Azeroth -- trolls, tauren, ogres, naga, the humans of Arathi before they became an empire, and many more still. A common denomÂ­inator among them are the brave and bold **tribal warriors** who patrol their borders.

Azeroth has seen countless wars, and a **veteran** of one is likely to be a veteran of many. Well-respected by their peers, it is not uncommon even for a long-retired veteran to still know their training by heart.

Sharply intelligent, immensely powerful, and often sardonic in nature, a **warlock** would seldom bother with people they perceive as inferior -- which is often most of them. Their demonic powers have them often, though not always, keeping some semblance loyalty to the Burning Legion.

Some arcanists devote their life to the art of warfare, taking on the title of **war mages**. They keep a keen mind for tactical and scholarly matters alike, and are often among the most respected advisors to leaders. Some such mages are even charismatic leaders in their own right.
